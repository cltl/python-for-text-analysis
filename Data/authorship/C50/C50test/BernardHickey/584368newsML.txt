A 22 percent rise in fee and other non-interest income boosted Westpac Banking Corp Ltd to a surprisingly strong first half profit result on Wednesday, more than offsetting the effect of a squeeze on interest margins.
Westpac announced a net profit of A$638 million for the six months to March 31, up from A$565 million in the same period a year earlier.  
Analysts said this was about A$20 million to A$30 million above their expectations, but had not shocked those in the market who had pushed Westpac's share price higher in recent weeks in anticipation of very strong result.
"That's why the stock hasn't bounced as much as you'd expect it to," Macquarie Equities banking analyst Graham Maloney said.
Westpac's shares were down five cents at A$7.45 at 3.40 p.m. (0540 GMT), having earlier jumped to a A$7.60 high.  
The profit jump was due largely to non-interest income rising to A$869 million from A$714 million, underpinned by rising account fees and some profits from the sale of property and closed branches.
The boost from fees more than offset sluggish growth in interest income as Westpac, like Australia's other major banks, battled a 150 basis point squeeze in home lending margins.
Westpac's group net interest margin fell to 3.55 percent in the six months to March 31 from 3.75 percent in the six months to September.  
Non-bank competitors funded by mortgage origination have snared more than 10 percent of the home mortgage market in the past three years, forcing banks to cut their home loan margins by about 150 basis points to about 100 to 150 basis points.
"Features of the first half financial results were non-interest expense control, continued improvement in asset quality, improved staff productivity, and higher non-interest income reflecting: growth in commissions and fees, higher financial markets income and benefits from the sale of equity investments," Westpac managing director Bob Joss said in a statement.  
"These results were achieved against a background of reduced interest margins and continued investments in strategic capabilities designed to enhance future prospects," Joss said.
Westpac's net interest income fell to A$1.695 billion in the six months ended March 31 from A$1.705 billion in the six months to September 30 last year, but was up on the A$1.549 billion in the year-ago period.
Income from fees and commissions rose to A$592 million from A$532 million in the year-ago first half.
Other income, which included the sale of equity investments, rose to A$142 million from A$68 million a year earlier.  
Westpac also announced it planned to raise up to A$500 million through a preference share issue after its merger with Bank of Melbourne Ltd.
Westpac said it would issue up to 20 million non-cumulative converting preference share at an issue price of A$25 each. The money raised would be used to fund the cash component under the Bank of Melbourne merger scheme, it said.
