Anglo-U.S. auto-components-to- aerospace giant LucasVarity, said on Tuesday it was sifting through some offers for the 13 companies earmarked for disposal under its post merger corporate shake-up.
Victor Rice, chief executive, told Reuters he expected the group to be in "active negotiations" on the sale of some of the non-core units quite soon. Only eight of the 13 businesses marked for sale were named in the restructuring statement released earlier. Rice said that major businesses like aerospace and electronics were not among the unnamed five.  
Rice refused to comment on how soon he expected the first disposals to go through.
The restructuring plans will be accelerated leading to the divestment of 13 business and 3,000 job cuts worldwide over two years.
Rice said the post-merger savings were "virtually double" original expectaions, with annual operating savings seen at 120 million stg by January 31 1999.
The criteria for divestment were those firms which "neither fitted into the core strategy of the company or contributed economic added value."
He said the process of raising cost efficiency continued and concluded that he was "pretty excited for the future."
