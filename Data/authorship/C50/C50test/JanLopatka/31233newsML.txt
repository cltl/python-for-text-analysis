The Czech government on Wednesday directed three ministers to oversee an investigation into the failure of the bank  Kreditni Banka a.s., Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said.
Klaus told a news conference Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky would join Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda, and Interior Minister Jan Ruml in overseeing the probe.
"Bearing in mind the extraordinary importance of this matter, the government authorised the group of three ministers to specially inquire into this issue, using all existing standard mechanisms," Klaus said.
He said authorities have been investigating the Kreditni case since the central bank rescinded its licence in August.
Findings from the investigation might lead to changes in Czech legislation, Klaus said.
Kreditni Banka was majority owned by the largest Czech insurer Ceska Pojistovna a.s..
The leader of the opposition Social Democrats, Milos Zeman, last weekend blamed Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and his ministry for lax banking supervision.
The central bank on Wednesday welcomed the probe.
"The CNB believes that through this work it will be possible to solve other cases as well in which the banking supervision has submitted a number of criminal reports on the basis of its knowledge gained in other banks," the central bank statement said.
Eleven banks have fallen since the liberalisation of the sector began in earnest in 1992.
Klaus attributed the failures of the banks -- all of them small or medium sized -- to growing pains in the transforming post-Communist Czech economy.
"I am 100 percent persuaded that the dominant cause of these phenomenona... is the difficulity, fragility, complexity of banking in the transformation phase," Klaus said.
