Declared cocoa arrivals at Ivorian ports for Ivory Coast's 1996/97 (October-April) main crop totalled 970-980,000 tonnes by April 14, close to record levels seen in the 1995/96 season, exporters and crop analysts said.
The 1995/96 main crop (ending April 30) reached just over a million tonnes.
"Arrivals are now at a trickle compared to last year but it is still possible the total (main crop) will reach a million by the end of the month," said one crop analyst.
Exporters said cocoa was arriving at Ivory Coast's two ports -- Abidjan and San Pedro -- at a total of up to 5,000 tonnes a week, compared to 8,000 tonnes a week in 1995/96.
Little or no main crop cocoa remained on south-western plantations visited by Reuters. "Cocoa is now for the mid-crop (usually smaller, poorer quality beans)," said one coastal area buyer.
Ivory Coast has forecast 950,000 tonnes for the 1996/97 season but some private forecasters upgraded their full-year predictions from that level to around 1.1 million tonnes after large arrivals in early 1997.
Last year, Ivory Coast produced a full-year record of 1.2 million tonnes after a bumper 200,000 tonne mid-crop (May-September).
Sources said Ministry of Agriculture data showed cocoa arrivals to April 4 (from October 24) stood at 940,0000 tonnes -- about six percent down from 1,003,366 last year. Another 40,000 tonnes or so should be added to the 1996/97 figure as the season opened three weeks later than the usual October 1, they said.
Other arrivals data seen by Reuters gave similar figures.
"The latest figures I have from the Caistab (cocoa and coffee marketing board) show arrivals at about 975,000 by April 14 but that is after some downward adjustments for sub-grade (inferior beans)," said one source.
Arrivals to the end of the main crop in 1994/95 were 815,000 tonnes, with weekly arrivals of under 4,000 tonnes.
Trade sources say exporters usually over-estimate arrivals early in the season to help secure bank finance, but square accounts later in the season by under-declaring.
Crop forecasters say declared arrivals in Ivory Coast can exceed tree crop harvests as quantities of cocoa are carried between seasons in the hope of price rises and to mix poor with good quality cocoa.
One cocoa buyer for Ivorian exporter Jean-Abile Gal (JAG) said the latest cocoa bean sizes averaged 98 beans per 100 grammes at San Pedro, and 105 at the main port, Abidjan -- against an export standard of up to 105 with less than eight percent humidity.
Exporters said average humidity levels at both ports were below eight percent.
Up-country buyers' stores in coastal and south-western areas were mostly empty, except for coffee, but larger warehouses at San Pedro, including JAG's, were still well stocked.
"There is nothing left. Some exporters are desperate to meet contracts and cannot get cocoa," said one buyer. "Cocoa harvested now is really for the mid-crop (from May)."
Port forwarders' figures seen by Reuters showed 1996/97 cocoa volumes handled 12 percent down on 1995/96, but managers said warehouse stocks for end-April shipment would close the gap.
"It is very acceptable. We thought the gap could be twice that," said a manager for SAGA, San Pedro's largest forwarder. "Last year, arrivals figures were a lot more available so it has been harder to track."
Cocoa bean shipments rose from 39,637 tonnes in February to 51,981 in March and at least another 10,000 tonnes was due to leave next week.
"Some of what is left in stores will be for local processors (using around 135,000 tonnes of beans a year)," said one crop analyst.
SACO, San Pedro's only factory, had large volumes of produce stored in sheds with bagged cocoa under external awnings. Cocoa product exports totalled around 4,000 tonnes for February and March.
Several new warehouses are planned to increase port cocoa storage capacity. New factories are also in the pipeline.
Exporters are now looking forward to pod counters' mid-crop predictions, expected this month, and further news on Ivory Coast's intention to destroy illegal cocoa plantations in classified forest areas.
The country's Minister for Commodities, Guy-Alain Gauze, said earlier on Friday in the Netherlands that the upcoming mid-crop would be somewhere near 100,000 tonnes.
