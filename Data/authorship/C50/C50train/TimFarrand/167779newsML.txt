John McGrath, chief executive of drinks and food company Grand Metropolitan, said the company should be able to return cash to shareholders in 1998 when its debt will be at least one billion pound lighter.
"By early next year our debt should be down in the low to middle two billion (stg) area and interest cover will be seven times or thereabouts. But we cannot afford buybacks at the moment. They depend entirely on our ability to sweat our assets and our ability to throw off enough cash in the next financial year."  
Market forecasts for 1997 pre-tax profits centre on a range of 1.04-1.06 billion stg for the full year to September 30, 1997 with many brokers cutting their estimates as sterling started its run up against the dollar in May. Estimates for GrandMet's 1996 pretax profits are bunched around the 980 million stg mark.
"We are really being hit by the dollar at the moment. At a rate of 1.60 it will hit us by about 16 million pounds a year, assuming this rate continues into 1997," McGrath said.
The dollar stood at 1.493 against the pound on May 1 before climbing to its 1.638 level today.
Pillsbury, GrandMet's U.S. foods business and Burger King generate about 60 percent of group earnings in dollars.
At GrandMet's spirits arm International Distillers and Vitners price rises have "stuck very well, probably better than they have done in a decade. Volumes are also up and we have had a good year in the U.S."
"I think what will surprise the competition will be our performance in Europe," he said.
