Sears, Roebuck and Co. Thursday said earnings jumped 24.6 percent in the fourth quarter, boosted by strong sales and improved profit margins during the Christmas selling season.
"We ended the year with excellent fourth-quarter results, which are even more impressive given the strength of last year's fourth quarter," Sears Chairman Arthur Martinez said in a statement.
December included the company's first ever back-to-back billion-dollar sales weeks, he said. The Christmas season is crucial for retailers since store chains typically earn half or more of their annual profit during the period.
"They had a great 1996 capped off by the best Christmas of any department store operator," said Alan Rifkin, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. He noted that Sears' sales at comparable stores rose 9.5 percent in December.
The nation's second-largest retailer said earnings rose to $567 million, or $1.42 a share, in the quarter, from $455 million,  or $1.13 a share, in the 1995 period. Sales grew 10.8 percent to $12.04 billion from $10.87 billion.
The earnings beat Wall Street forecasts that averaged $1.38 a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.
But Sears' stock fell $2 to $49.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, mostly on profit-taking.
"The stock was up strongly early in the week and I think people are just taking profits," Rifkin said.
Analysts said Sears gained from its decision to remodel some stores and expand its clothing offerings.
"Clearly they're gaining market share and clearly they're doing the right thing and the consumer likes what she sees when she goes into the store," said Karen Sack, analyst at the S&amp;P Equity Group.
Operating income from domestic operations rose 14.8 percent to $531 million in the quarter as revenue rose 11.6 percent to $10.92 billion. Comparable-store sales rose 5.4 percent for the quarter.
Operating income from domestic operations for all of 1996 rose 20.9 percent to $1.28 billion, while revenues increased 10.2 percent to $34.85 billion.
Gross margins as a percent of merchandise sales rose to 27.9 percent from 26.9 percent in the 1995 period.
Rifkin said margins were not likely to rise as much in 1997 as in the fourth quarter, but said cost-cutting should drive earnings growth this year.
He forecast earnings at $3.60 a share in 1997 and $4.25 a share in 1998, up from $3.12 a share in 1996.
International operations, including merchandising and credit operations in Canada and Mexico, earned $36 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $7 million in the 1995 period.
The increase in earnings was largely attributable to improved performance at both Sears Canada and Sears Mexico, lower selling and administrative expenses at Sears Mexico, and writeoffs of Sears Canada properties in the year-ago quarter, it said.
Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., operates more than 800 department stores and 2,500 other stores offering clothing, home and automotive products and services.
While earnings rose in the quarter, they fell for the year, in part because 1995 included a gain of $776 million from the former Allstate Corp. subsidiary, which was spun off to Sears' shareholders in June 1995.
For all of 1996, Sears earned $1.27 billion, or $3.12 a share, in net profits, down from $1.80 billion, or $4.50 a share, in 1995. Sales grew 9 percent to $38.22 billion from $35.0 billion.
