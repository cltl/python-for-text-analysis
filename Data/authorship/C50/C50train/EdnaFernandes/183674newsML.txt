Imperial Tobacco Plc, fresh from its split from Hanson Plc, has admitted that its former parent group did receive a takeover approach prior to the demerger but rejected it because the price was too low.
Imperial's chief executive Gareth Davis told Reuters in an interview this week: "A phone call was made to Grosvenor Place (Hanson's headquarters) but they were talking silly prices." He confirmed that the interested party was a tobacco firm, but refused to comment on recent speculation that B.A.T. Industries Plc was a potential buyer.
