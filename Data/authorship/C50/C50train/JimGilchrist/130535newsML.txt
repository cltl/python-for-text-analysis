The head of British Airways World Cargo (BAWC) in Hong Kong, Chris Humphrey, said he is confident of a "dramatic improvement" in freight handling service standards at London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports.
One leading Hong Kong air freight forwarder said he is just one customer who is "appalled" at BAWC's handling of ex-Hong Kong cargo in London. One recent consignment took three and a half days to clear Gatwick, the forwarder said speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, adding he tries to avoid Heathrow wherever possible because of "indefensible" service standards. BA recently had its ISO service standard award at its main Heathrow cargo hub revoked.
Chris Humphrey, BAWC's regional cargo manager Pacific said he is aware of the problems and has assured customers that improvements are under way.
In an interview in Hong Kong, he said major changes to working practices at Gatwick, which receives Hong Kong's three freighter flights per week, had caused a "short term downturn in service standards".
At Heathrow, there have also been changes. BAWC's newly opened dedicated centre for freight from the Pacific region began handling Hong Kong cargo earlier this month. BA has said the centre will create a series of customer benefits and relieve pressure from its World Cargocentre hub.
"Again I am confident that we will see a dramatic improvement in our service standards there. I won't deny that we have had problems working in a very old building which is over capacity. We are aware of that and are working very hard to bring our working practices up to date and doing an awful lot of changes in a short time which is causing pain on the labour relations front. We lost the ISO from our main cargo hub but Pacific routes and cargo from Hong Kong still goes through an ISO qualified warehouse," Humphrey said.
"Things are getting better," he added. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
