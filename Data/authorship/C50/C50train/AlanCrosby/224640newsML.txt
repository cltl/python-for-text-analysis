Markets across Eastern Europe
remained mired in an autumn slump this week, with analysts
saying they see little impetus on the horizon to break the
bearish trend.
Stock Exchanges in Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava, Bucharest,
Zagreb and Ljubljana all lost ground on the week, while
Budapest bucked the trend, rising slightly though it appeared
to lose steam by week's end.
PRAGUE
Not even a strong showing by the centre-right governing
coalition in Senate elections at the weekend could break the
Prague Stock Exchange out of its current slump, as the PX50
index dipped 0.8 points on the week to close Thursday at 509.3.
Analysts said that while the coalition of Prime Minister
Vaclav Klaus may feel heartened by the showing which gave him a
majority to the Czech upper house, which will have little
power, investors are still put off by poor market regulation.
"I'm a little sceptical about the possibility that the
Senate will help bring changes to the market," said Pavel
Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka.
"I think there will be a lot of pressure from market
participants on the government to do something...but I have not
seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with
respect to this topic."
Investors have long complained that market regualtion and
legislation in the Czech Republic is weak, providing little
protection for minority shareholders.
WARSAW
The Warsaw Stock Exchange stayed virtually flat this week
and analysts were divided over the market's direction.
Some said the bourse could extend its three-week horizontal
trend as no fresh signals were in sight. "We are still in a
horizontal trend and...I see no factors which could help create
a clear direction for the market," said Mateusz Andrzejewski,
an analyst at Pekao SA brokerage.
But others saw the generally positive economic climate as
an impulse strong enough that it could help the bourse climb
above 14,000 points next week.
Analysts said a senior central bank official's comment on
Tuesday on a possible rise in interest rates next year was
bringing some uncertainty to the bourse but was unlikely to
signficantly hurt prices.
BUDAPEST
Hungarian shares, triggered by last Thursday's government
decision to hike energy prices, started off the weekend
strongly, but ran out of steam by mid-week.
Oil and gas company MOL led the charge, but dealers said
its weakening on Thursday could be a harbinger for the bourse.
"MOL turned around today (on Thursday), that is a warning
sign," said New York Broker's Kalman Schuszter. "Sellers are
stronger now." The BUX index closed on Thursday at 3,674.61, up
3.1 percent from Monday's open.
BRATISLAVA
Slovak share prices continued their freefall over the
course of the week, in a rampant bear market that has seen the
Bratislava Stock Exchange lose about 25 percent since the end
of August.
The 12-share SAX index fell 12.49 points on the week to
close at 161.82 on Thursday.
Dealers said the silver lining to the bourse's woes may be
that prices are becoming so cheap, foreign investors will soon
be lured back.
BUCHAREST
Scant demand kept volumes modest at both weekly sessions in
Bucharest, with turnover low and most prices edging down or
staying flat.
The unofficial VAB index inched down from the previous
session by 1.1 percent to 294.2 points, while the BIG index
eased 1.07 percent to 293.41.
Fertiliser maker Azomures SA dominated trading,
while newcomer, an oilfield equipment maker, put on
a poor show.
ZAGREB
Croatian stocks were mostly lower in dwindling trade and
analysts said they could see no end to the bearish period as
big buyers continue to shy away from the market because of
political developments.
Croatia has been shaken by a wave of strikes, and last week
Zagreb saw its biggest protest in years.
LJUBLJANA
Political concerns were also apparent in Ljubljana this
week, with investors waiting for a new prime minister to be
named, probably in the second half of December.
"The market will be uneasy until it is clear who will form
the new government," one trader said. The SBI index fell 6,7
points from MOnday's open to close on Thursday at 1,145.5.
Although the Liberal Democrats of current Prime Minister
Janez Drnovsek were the strongest single party in the November
general election, winning 25 out of 90 parliamentary seats,
they are facing a loose alliance of rightist "Spring" parties,
who got 45 seats.
