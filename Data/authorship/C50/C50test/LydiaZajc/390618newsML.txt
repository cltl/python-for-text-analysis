Toronto stocks closed weaker in heavy trading on Thursday after a last minute sell-off that was led by New York.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index lost 43.79 points to settle at 6205.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 92.75 points to reach 6927.38.
Canada's largest equities market also posted its heaviest trading session and highest value ever, with 169.4 million shares traded worth C$2.97 billion ($2.18 billion).
Despite the drop, the 300 index did not cross the key support mark of 6175 points, said portfolio consultant Ron Meisels. "We're still actually very much above the break-out level," he said.
Toronto's losses were checked by a soaring gold group, which rocketed 3.23 percent on surging bullion price on COMEX. April gold closed $5.00 higher an ounce at $352.70.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices lost ground except for golds and retail. Consumer products led losses, followed by banks, oils and utilities.
