Westpac Banking Corp Ltd is expected to report on Tuesday that its net profit growth was reined back to a slower 10 percent in the 1995/96 year by an increasingly competitive home loan sector and a slower economy.
Analysts said the main focus in the results would be on how that increased competition and recent sharp cuts in home lending margins would hit Westpac's profits in 1996/97.
"You're really only going to have a full impact for the year ending September 1997," Morgan Stanley banking analyst John Hobson said of the sliding home loan margins.  
"There'll start to be a moderating influence (on profits) which intensifies throughout 1997," he said.
"You'll see fairly cautious statements being made at the briefing."
The median forecast in BZW's BARCEPs analyst survey is for a net profit before abnormals for the year to September 30, 1996 of A$1.12 billion, up about 10 percent from A$1.02 billion in 1994/95.
This compares with a 44 percent rise between 1993/94 and 1994/95.
