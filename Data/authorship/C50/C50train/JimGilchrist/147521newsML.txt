Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair) is increasing its flights to Sendai in Japan from October 29 to six a week from the present four, the carrier's chief operating officer Philip Chen said in a statement.
"Our services to Hiroshima and Sendai are a good example of how Dragonair is spreading out and serving the region. Since we started Hiroshima in 1992 and Sendai in 1993 both have been very successful and we are increasing frequencies on both these routes to cope with demand," he added
One of Dragonair's current fleet of seven Airbus Industrie A320 will be used for the extra frequency, a spokeswoman added.
On October 24, Airbus said Dragonair had signed a contract an order for two more A320s, plus options for five others along with the lease of another Airbus A330-300.
The new planes will be used to cope with further route expansion to China and other Asian destinations, especially when Hong Kong's new round the clock airport opens in 18 months time, industry sources said.
