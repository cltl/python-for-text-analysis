Sir Ian Prosser, chairman of brewer-to-leisure group Bass Plc, said the company's proposed acquisition of brewer Carlsberg-Tetley would make Britain's beer market more competitive.
"Obviously it would make the market more competitive. We would be looking to lower our cost base which would give us more money to invest in innovation and more money to invest in improving our products," said Prosser in an interview.
The acquisition is being studied by the Board of Trade on competition grounds. Their decision is expected in a few weeks.
