Rumours Swiss drugs group Roche Holding has designs on Anglo-American group SmithKline Beecham Plc need to be treated with intense caution, analysts said on Wednesday.
Shares in SmithKline Beecham Plc rose sharply in late trading, closing up 30 1/2 pence at 788, while in Zurich shares in Roche dropped 140 Swiss francs to 9,830 francs.
Analysts said rumours that Roche was trying to put together a funding package of up to 50 billion Swiss Francs had fueled the late buying of SmithKline.  
But one analyst with a European bank who asked not to be named said rumours about Roche, which has most commonly been cited as a suitor for another British company, Zeneca Group Plc, have become a regular feature of the market.
Both Roche and SmithKline declined to comment on the speculation.
SmithKline had a market capitalization of around 21.3 billion stg at the close of trading on Wednesday and analysts said a hostile bid would probably lead to a 30 to 40 percent premium on top of this.  
Roche, which is worth 95.1 billion Swiss francs, already has a cash pile of around six billion Swiss francs to fund any ambitions it might have.
Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull's director of equity research Paul Diggle said: "Don't hold your breath, but it isn't that stupid." But Diggle said an agreed merger between the two companies was more feasible than a takeover. He noted that Roche and SmithKline, which are both in the world's top 10 in terms of sales, have made no secret of their desire to be bigger in a rapidly consolidating drugs market and a merger could "satisfy the ambition of both companies."  
A merger would give Roche and SmithKline Beecham a combined world market share of over five percent, putting them on a par with current world leader Glaxo Wellcome Plc.
SmithKline would also offer Roche a much firmer footing in the key U.S. market, where it lacks critical mass. Roche's vitamin business, which is the biggest in the world, would provide a useful fit with SmithKline' consumer healthcare and over-the-counter drugs operations.
In terms of drugs, both companies have strong portfolios of central nervous sytem drugs and antibiotics.
However, a UK brokerage analysts, who also declined to be identified, said that, beyond size, a merger with SmithKline would offer little in the way of attractions for Roche.
"If I was the finance director of Roche I would look at SmithKline and see there was a lot of stuff I didn't want," he said. SmithKline's involvement in the U.S. pharmacy benefit management business would offer few attractions to Roche, whose drugs are targeted largely at hospitals, he added.
