The Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents (HAFFA) is to raise some of its freight charges from January 1, HAFFA chairman Sam Chung has told Reuters.
But he said the majority of rates, including handling and documentation, terminal charges and attendance fees will not increase.
"HAFFA's goal is to keep freight costs down in order to maintain Hong Kong's position as Asia's leading air freight centre. We raised tariffs this year only on essential, mainly labour intensive items. Although Hong Kong's overall economic situation remains good, salaries and overheads have escalated substantially and the increases in selected rates are necessary in order to keep pace with this," Chung said.
HAFFA said there will be a 6.2 percent increase in air freight flat pack cartage charges to HK$1.40 per kg. Devanning charges will rise by 3.5 percent to 29.5 cents per kg. Container field station loading and unloading charges will rise by 6.7 percent to HK$160 per consignment.
