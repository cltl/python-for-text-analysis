Czech paper concern Sepap Group a.s. on Friday said its nine-month net profit fell as a shutdown of its main paper mill, coupled with a downturn in the paper cycle bit into its bottom line.
Sepap said its nine-month net profit, calculated according to international accounting standards, fell to 188.4 million crowns from 520.4 million over the same period in 1995, while revenues slumped to 3.94 billion crowns from 5.34 billion.
The firm said results from the third quarter only had stabilised after a first half industry downtrend, though "the planned annual shutdown of the Steti mill lowered earnings by virtue of the expected higher maintenance costs associated with the stoppage".
"Overall, Sepap year-end ernings are expected to rise and show a slight improvement over third quarter levels," a company statement said.
The Steti mill, which accounts for some three-quarters of the group's revenues and profits, saw its pre-tax profits plummet to seven million crowns.
Comparative figures were not immediately available, but the mill's nine-month 1995 gross profit was some 95 million crowns.
"The market place is sending mixed signals for the fourth quarter. Anticipated price increases have not taken hold at the anticipated levels in all of the pulp and paper grades," the statement said.
It added that the group's second biggest subsidiary, newsprint maker ROTO, "continued to produce good results in a market that is weakening".
ROTO showed a nine-month pre-tax profit of 149 million crowns on sales of 1.25 billion crowns.
Last year, Sepap was the center of a heated battle for control between Bahamas-based investor Michael Dingman and Swedish forestry concern Assidoman.
Dingman, who controls 48 percent of Sepap through his Daventree Ltd investment company, won the battle, but later accepted Assidoman's role as a strategic partner in the paper industry. The Swedish firm holds a 39 percent stake in Sepap.
