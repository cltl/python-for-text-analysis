Ford Motor Company Ltd, the U.S. carmaker's U.K. arm, said on Tuesday that the British sales outlook for 1997 looked pretty flat as customers suffered from a "feeling-not-so-good" factor.
Ian McAllister, chairman and managing director of Ford U.K., told Reuters in an interview at the British International Motor Show that weak sentiment was the primary reason for sluggish interest among UK consumers in the last three years.
"People were badly bitten by the recession and have become cautious about their own personal balance sheets," he said.
He added that it would require an end to consumer worries, like house owners' negative equity, and a cure for the recessionary hangover before the private car market took off.
Industry analysts have said that most of the growth in the UK car market has been due to companies buying cars, rather than the man on the street snapping up new models.
McAllister said company fleet sales would remain a priority for Ford in the coming year but said, "We will reduce our exposure to the heavily discounted rental market."
The UK chief agreed that the slight growth in sales across the wider European car market so far in 1996 had been distorted by government incentives in countries like France to trade in fuel guzzling old cars for new models, as well as heavy discounting by most car makers.
The underlying picture for the European car industry has been less promising, he acknowleged, agreeing that excess market capacity in Europe had fuelled downward pressure on margins for players across the board.
