Lord Douro, deputy chairman of Vendome Luxury Goods, whose products are especially popular with Japanese consumers, said he thinks the yen has stabilised against the dollar and may improve.
"Chinese demand continues to increase strongly and the Japanese currency will stabilise if not improve from here and we will benefit from that," said Douro in an interview.
The yen reached a five year low of 82.52 against the dollar in April 1995. This April 1, at the start of Vendome's half year reporting period ending September 30, it stood at 107.17, before rising to around its current 111 level.
