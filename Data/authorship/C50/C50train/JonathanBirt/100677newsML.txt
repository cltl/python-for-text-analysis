Drug discovery specialist Chiroscience Group plc said on Monday it is testing two anti-cancer compounds before deciding which will go forward into human trials before the end of the year.
Both are MMP inhibitors, the same novel class of drug as British Biotech Plc's potential blockbuster Marimastat, which are believed to stop cancer cells from spreading.
In an interview, chief executive John Padfield said Chiroscience hoped to have its own competitor to Marimastat in early trials next year and Phase III trials in 1998.
