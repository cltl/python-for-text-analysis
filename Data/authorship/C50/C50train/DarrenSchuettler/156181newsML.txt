The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Index reached its 50th record close of 1996 on Thursday and broke the 5600 barrier for the first time.
The TSE 300 Composite Index rose 8.01 points to close at 5598.82, surpassing a streak of 45 record finishes in 1987.
The Index also breached the 5600 barrier, setting an intraday high of 5601.88.
"It's just another record in a string of more to come. This won't be the last," said Fred Ketchen, senior vice-president and director of equity trading for ScotiaMcLeod Inc, a unit of Bank of Nova Scotia.
Toronto's record-setting run was led by banking, communications, conglomerates and technology issues. Of the TSE's 14 sub-groups, 10 finished higher.
The rally was restrained by 162-point loss in golds.
Trading was brisk with 113.8 million shares exchanging hands for a value of C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion).
Advancing stocks outnumbered declines 538 to 434 with 294 issues unchanged.
Traditionally, October has been a scary month for investors who remember the massive crash of 1987.
"This is the time when everything is supposed to fall apart, but it has been a rather strong month," Ketchen said.
* Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal Bank of Canada set all-time highs as the bank group continued their climb since summer. Scotiabank closed up 0.45 at 42.25 after reaching a 52-week high of 42.40. Royal Bank added 0.60 to close at 44.30 after hitting a 52-week peak of 44.40.
* Among weak gold issues, Barrick Gold Corp fell 0.50 to 35.10 on 1.5 million shares. COMEX gold futures slumped for a second straight session on Thursday.
* Molson Cos Ltd jumped 0.40 to 20.50 after its brewing unit, Molson Breweries, reached an interim deal with U.S. beermaker Adolph Coors Co on the sale of Coors beer in Canada.
An arbitration panel two weeks ago ruled that Molson Breweries breached its licensing deal by allowing Miller Brewing Co., a unit of Philip Morris Cos Inc, to buy a 20 percent stake without Coors' consent in 1993.
