After years of delay, regulators are set to announce approval of plans to create a new type of radio service that offers CD-quality sound and can be heard by listeners coast-to-coast, government officials said Friday.
The four members of the Federal Communications Commission have resolved long-standing differences over allocating the two available radio licenses to the four companies seeking to offer so-called Digital Audio Radio Service, or DARS.  
The four are: CD Radio Inc.; American Mobile Radio Corp., a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp.; Digital Broadcast Satellite Corp.; and Primosphere.
An official who requested anonymity said the FCC approval is expected to be announced soon, possibly later Friday or on Monday.
Despite reservations from two commissioners, the agency has decided to limit an auction of the two licenses to the four companies -- which had filed applications with the FCC in the early 1990s.  
On Monday, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt had raised the specter of a potential snag. He insisted an auction should be open to any company that wants to bid, instead of the existing four.
Such a wide-open auction could have raised a more money for the government by attracting more bidders.
Hundt noted that MCI Communications Corp last year paid $683 million to win the last remaining satellite slot to beam television programs nationwide.
But the government officials said that the commissioners finally decided to allow the limited auction to proceed, given that the applicants have been waiting for years.
