Toronto stocks finished one percent higher on Tuesday, following a rally in New York as investors speculated the U.S. central bank may not raise interest rates after surprisingly weak U.S. economic data.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index rose 67.98 points to close at 5903.56. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 179 points to finish at 6962.
"Economic stats came through this morning that suggest the economy is slowing down," said Ira Katzin, an investment advisor with Toronto-based brokerage RBC Dominion Securities.
The U.S. employment cost index rose 0.6 percent in the first quarter, compared with economists' expectations of a 0.9 percent increase.
Also, April's index of U.S. consumer confidence dipped to 116.8 in April from 118.5 in March.
The numbers suggested the U.S. Federal Reserve may not have to increase short-term interest rates at a May meeting, Katzin added.
Toronto's 14 sub-indices strengthened across the board except for pipelines. Rallying groups were led by media, consumer products, interest rate sensitive banks and retail issues.
Turnover was brisk at 102 million shares worth C$1.8 billion (US$1.3 billion).
Advancing stocks overwhelmed declining issues 580 to 397, while 227 stocks were unchanged.
Amid hot stocks, Royal Bank of Canada jumped 1.50 to 55.15. Bank of Montreal rose 1.15 to 50.25.
Gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. edged up 0.15 to close at 3.80. Busang partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc., said at its annual meeting on Tuesday that it hoped an independent audit expected later this week would resolve conflicting estimates of gold reserves at the project.
