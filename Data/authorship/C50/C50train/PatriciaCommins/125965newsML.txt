McDonald's Corp said its new restaurant openings for 1996 and 1997 likely will be at the low-end of its targeted range of 2,500 to 3,200 units.
"We will hit the low end of our projected range (with) 2,500-plus restaurants (in 1996)," McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling told Reuters. "We're just doing our planning for next year, but we expect to do 2,500 plus next year."
This would be the first time in at least three years that McDonald's failed to beat its expansion projections, as it cuts back on limited menu -- or satellite -- units.  
In 1995, McDonald's opened 2,430 units, beating the projection for that year of 2,300. In 1994, it opened 1,800 units, beating the projection of about 1,400 to 1,700.
McDonald's has nearly 20,000 restaurants worldwide.
"We've been ratcheting up the level of development every year since around 1991," Ebeling said.
Ebeling said McDonald's this year plans to open about "600-plus" satellite units worldwide, down from its original plan of 700 to 1,000 satellites. The biggest decline will be seen in the United States.  
"We recognize we need higher volume restaurants to meet the kind of profitability that we'd like for ourselves and our franchisees," Ebeling said.
Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes said the profitability of some satellite units, which are often built in non-traditional sites such as shopping malls, has been uncertain. "In the big picture, the financial performance of satellites appears to be spotty," Oakes said.
Ebeling said U.S. satellite units will account for about one-third of the total for these smaller sites, down from 60 percent as originally planned.  
Overall, Ebeling said about one-third of McDonald's restaurant openings will still be in the United States.
Bear, Stearns analyst Joseph Buckley added he would not be surprised to see McDonald's shift its restaurant opening strategy to further emphasize the international market.
McDonald's said operating income outside the United States contributed 59 percent to consolidated income for the quarter.
Earlier, McDonald's reported third quarter income of $0.62 a share, $0.01 below the consensus estimate, but above the $0.56 it earned last year.
McDonald's said its U.S. operating income was down five percent in the quarter, which it blamed partly on an intensely competitive operating environment.
Same-store sales in the United States, measuring results for units open for at least one year, were negative in the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year.
But U.S sales may be picking up, Oakes added.
"I think (U.S. same-store sales) are starting to hit bottom," Oakes said. "Thus far in October, it (seems) like they have picked up and are in the flattish range."
