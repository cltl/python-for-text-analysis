Software firm Computer Associates International Inc. stock dropped more than 6 percent Wednesday, and analysts said the slump reflected concern over an unexpected decline in mainframe computer revenues.
Although the Islandia, N.Y.-based company issued cautionary comments in late December that revenues were unlikely to meet expectations due to sales problems in its European operations, analysts said they were caught off guard by the slippage in mainframe software sales reported late Tuesday.
Computer Associates stock fell $2.50 to $43.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most active issues.
Analysts said the decline may also be linked to broader weakness in the mainframe business, citing disappointing growth in International Business Machines Corp.'s hardware business during the December quarter.
IBM is the world's dominant supplier of mainframe software, while Computer Associates is a leading independent supplier of software used to run mainframe machines.
"People got spooked about the mainframe business," said Alex. Brown brokerage analyst Chris Mortenson, who noted the company told analysts in a conference call Tuesday night that mainframe revenues fell 8 percent in the December quarter.
Despite mounting mainframe revenue concerns, most analysts left earnings estimates and stock ratings untouched.
The stock has fallen back in recent weeks from the historic high of just under $68 it acheived in early December.
Computer Associates reported operating earnings of $284.7 million, or 75 cents a share, for its fiscal third quarter vs. $227.2 million, or 60 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. The latest quarter excluded a $598 million acquisition charge.
The company, which has historically derived more than 70 percent of its revenues from mainframe sales, said mainframe software accounted for 61 percent of revenues in the December quarter, while PC network software amounted to 39 percent.
