Go-Ahead Group Plc, the UK transport company, and its French partner VIA-GTI are set to be announced as the preferred bidder for the Thameslink passenger rail franchise, industry sources told Reuters on Thursday.
An official announcement is expected from the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) imminently.
The joint venture, which is 65 percent owned by Go-Ahead and 35 percent by the VIA-GTI, is called GOVIA.  
Go-Ahead has already won the Thames rail franchise and GOVIA had been shortlisted for Thameslink, as well as ScotRail and Regional Railways North East.
The Thameslink rail franchise runs to Luton and Gatwick airports through the financial district of London and is seen as having great potential as a fast-link to these major UK airports.
Go-Ahead is a bus and rail operator. As well as becoming a player in the rail franchise market, it also has around eight percent of the UK bus market, with fleets running in London, Oxford and the north east of England.
The group has been among a number of UK bus companies to move into rail, fuelling growth in earnings, which has triggered a strong rise in its share price.
