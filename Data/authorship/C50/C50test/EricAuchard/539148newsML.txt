U S West Communications Group. reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings Friday, citing successful marketing programmes and tighter cost controls.
The Englewood, Colo.-based telephone operator earned $328 million, or 68 cents per share, in the first quarer, up from $289 million, or 61 cents, a year earlier.
The earnings were several cents ahead of Wall Street expectations, which, according to First Call Inc., put earnings at 65 cents a share.
"U S West Communications Group has started off 1997 with double-digit momentum on the heels of 1996's accelerating results," said Richard McCormick, chairman of U S West Inc., the holding group for the phone company.
U S West Communications serves more than 25 million customers in 14 Western and Midwestern states.
U S West officials cautioned analysts against raising their earnings projections for the year, saying investments in new wireless networks and growing competition were likely to dampen earnings growth.
The current consensus estimate for the 1997 year has U S West Communications earning $2.54 per share vs. $2.44 per share in 1996, according to First Call.
"Absent a significant regulatory shift, we remain comfortable with the consensus estimate for the 1997 year," Chief Financial Officer Allan Spies told Wall Street analysts.
Spies stood by a prediction U S West made at a February analysts' meeting, projecting overall earnings growth of 4 percent to 6 percent in 1997. First-quarter 1997 earnings per share grew 11.5 percent.
Revenues rose 5 percent to $2.59 billion from $2.46 billion.
The company said local service revenues grew 7.5 percent to $1.23 billion in the quarter, with almost half the growth driven by sales of value-added features beyond basic access.

Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Klugman said the company also benefited from labour cost cuts. U S West Communications trimmed 4,000 employees in the last four quarters. It now has a work force of just over 47,000.
