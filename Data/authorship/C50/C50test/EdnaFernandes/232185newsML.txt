Racal Electronics Plc, the defence to communications group hit by a profit warning on Monday which flagged poor interim results on Tuesday, has blamed last minute delays in foreign government defence orders hitting its revenue targets.
David Elsbury, chief executive, told Reuters, that news of the order slippage was only uncovered as late as last Friday. The defence orders were earmarked for the radio division which provides defence related equipment to foreign governments.  
After meeting with advisers over the weekend, the group decided to revise its profit outlook down. He cited the example of one South American government forced to put back its order after being hit by changes in copper prices.
The division is already undergoing a strategic review which is expected to report back in March.
Elsbury stressed that although orders have been pushed back to next year, none have been lost.
He said other divisions, including network services, had shown strong profit growth, citing the recently acquired British Rail Telecoms business as a "superb performer."
Data Products is on the verge of a turnaround. "In the second half we should see a profit. We haven't seen that for many years," said Elsbury.
