British pub to hotels group Greenalls Plc should report a near 20 percent rise in its full year profits on Thursday as its acquisition of Boddington Group feeds through into its managed pub estate, analysts said.
Analysts' forecasts for pretax profits in the year to September 27 range from 145 to 150 million stg excluding an exceptional 30 million stg for the cost of reorganising Boddington's, up from 100.5 million last time. Dividend forecasts are centred on a total payout of 15.4p.  
The acquisition of Boddington for 527 million stg in November 1995 added 458 pubs to the group's portfolio and made Greenalls the largest independent retail pub chain with 2,370 outlets. Some 270 former Boddington's managed pubs were absorbed into Greenalls Inns.
At the time of the acquisition Greenalls identified 18 million stg of cost savings from closing Boddington's offices and wholesale depots.
However, confusion remains among analysts about how former Boddington assets have been absorbed.  
Trading profits from its managed pubs are anticipated to be up some 45 percent at 76 million stg, driven by the inclusion of the Boddington estate for the first full year.
Profits from its hotel and restaurants division should grow about 10 percent to 58 million. The company announced the long-awaited sale of its six hotels in the United States on Friday for 14 million stg in cash with a loss on the disposal of 1.75 million.
"It's definitely a welcome sight to see. Those hotels have rarely been in profit over the last ten years," said one analyst who declined to be named.  
The division also includes De Vere Hotels, Village Leisure -- acquired from Boddington -- and the branded Premier House pub restaurants.
Earnings from the group's tenanted pubs and wholesaling are likely to be up about 25 percent at 50 million. At the end of August, Inn Partnership comprised 1,194 tenanted houses including 145 former Boddington tenanted pubs.
This division also includes 460 off-licenses and a distillery.
Analysts envisage an interest charge of about 38 million.  
Investors and analysts are keen to hear how the brands acquired from Boddington's are fitting in.
"There are a number of retail brands in this vastly enlarged group and it would be interesting to see which ones it considers to be really important for the future, " said Colin Humphreys, analyst at Panmure Gordon.
Greenalls shares were off 6p at 596 on Friday at 1100 GMT, well off their 637p year high. The company improved operating margin to 17.6 percent in 1995 from 16.75 percent a year earlier.  
Its return on equity rose to 13.15 percent from 10.39 over the same period, compared with 9.84 percent for Whitbread.
A Reuter poll of 24 brokers produced a consensus estimate EPS for the full year ending September 27, 1996 of 38.5 rising to 42.5 in 1997.
