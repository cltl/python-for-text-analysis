Ceska Sporitelna a.s., the largest Czech savings bank, said on Thursday its 1996 audited net profit rose to 1.89 billion crowns ($65 million) from 263 million in 1995, using Czech acounting standards.
Speaking at a news conference, the bank's general director Jaroslav Klapal said the result was opening room for a higher dividend than last year's five crowns per share, but he declined to specify what the board's proposal would be.
Deputy CEO Kamil Ziegler said results under international accounting standards (IAS) would be released together with the bank's consolidated results in mid April.
"We think that the profit under international standards will be similar, probably little lower, by 100 million (crowns) at the most," Ziegler told reporters.
The bank's balance sheet dipped to 359 billion crowns at the end of last year from 368 billion in 1995 on losses from exposure on the interbank market, and concentration on client loans, Ziegler said.
"We are happy with this result, it is a reflection of our strategy of a shift from the interbank market," he said. "This year, we expect the balance sheet total to rise by eight percent."
Last year Sporitelna, the former communist monolith where most Czechs kept personal deposits, cut its interbank market exposure to 28.4 percent of total assets from 40 percent in 1995, while loans to clients rose to 42.1 percent from 34.4.
Ziegler said net interest income dipped to 13.39 billion from 13.65 billion in 1995, while non-interest income rose to 4.26 from 3.99 billion.
He said profits should also rise this year, but declined to give more details of Sporitelna's financial plans.
The bank's gross profit was the same as the net result, as the bank paid no income tax.
In 1995 the gross profit was 9.31 billion crowns, but net earnings were dramatically lower after auditors forced Sporitelna to set aside 7.1 billion into reserves to cover exposure in doubtfull loans.
In the 1996, accounting period Sporitelna said it put aside 4.66 billion crowns for reserves. Klapal said this figure should decline to 3.1 billion in 1997.
Klapal also said Sporitelna was interested in converting more shares into global depository receipts, after last year's tranche of some seven percent underwritten by Bankers Trust.
The director said Sporitelna would close 500 small branches this year of the total number of 1,700, and lay off 2,000 employees of the current 18,709.
The bank's capital adequacy ratio, calculated under CNB practices, fell to 8.86 percent form 10.98, as a result of rising proportion of loans to clients which are covered from 100 percent in the domestic calculation as opposed to loans to banks which only need 20 percent, Ziegler said.
The proportion of classified loans rose to 24.72 percent from 20.86 percent, also due to the change in loan structure, Ziegler said.
