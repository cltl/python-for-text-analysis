French energy group Total SA on Wednesday reported a 50 percent increase in its 1996 net income to 5.6 billion francs ($1 billion), boosted by higher oil prices, a firmer dollar, improved refining margins and productivity gains.
The profit figure, which was in line with financial analysts' expectations, would have shown a 150 percent increase if 1995 special charges of 1.5 billion francs were taken into account.
Operating income rose by 37 percent to 10.2 billion francs on 30 percent higher sales of 176 billion francs.
Total chairman Thierry Desmarest said the profit improvement compared with rises of some 25 percent at U.S. oil majors.
Larger French group Elf in December said its 1996 net income would be between 7.3 and 7.5 billion francs compared with 5.3 billion in 1995, or some 40 percent higher.
Total shares rose on the figures, adding 0.76 percent to 477.70 francs at 1203 GMT while the blue-chip index was down 0.65 percent.
"A more favourable operating environment in 1996 than 1995 accounts for more than half of (the) 3.3 billion franc increase in operating income," Total said, adding external factors such as these had a positive impact of two billion francs.
The U.S. dollar rose to an average rate of 4.99 francs in 1995 to 5.12 francs in 1996, Brent oil rose to 20.7 per barrel from $17.04 per barrel while the refining margins improved to $13.6 per ton from $11.4 per ton.
Productivity gains contributed 500 million francs to the improvement and higher volumes 1.1 billion. An increase in operating expenses trimmed the total gain by 300 million.
Desmarest said he expected the oil price to slip in 1997, due to the return of Iraq to the market and higher production by non OPEC members, but he expected it not to fall as far as the 1994/1995 low of $16.40 a barrel.
"I do not think that we will continue to see the favourable prices from the start of the year," Desmarest said. "But it is very unlikely that it will return to a level of $16.40 per barrel."
Total expects a further increase in profits but Desmarest declined to be drawn into precise forecasts.
"Continuing production growth and ongoing productivity gains projected over the next few years should allow the company to improve profitability relative to the 1996 level of return on equity." Total said.
Desmarest told the news conference that he aimed to get a four billion franc increase in the years up to 1999. "For the next three years, and with unchanged circumstances, we aim to improve the operating results by four billion francs," he said.
Total aims to boost its investments in 1997 to 18 billion francs, from 16 billion in 1995, with the lion's share going to upstream activities -- exploration and production.
Desmarest said that by the year 2000, he expected about half of the company's operating income to come from exploration and production, while both the downstream and chemicals activities would have a slice of 20 to 25 percent.
Total aims to have reserves to allow it to tap into more than one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year 2000 and planned further growth after that.
In downstream, refining and marketing, Total is still faced with a weak European market.
Desmarest said the company was ready to participate in a restructuring of the refining industry but he did not plan to shut Total's refineries. Instead he was willing to offer access to the refineries to other operators in exchange for closures.
