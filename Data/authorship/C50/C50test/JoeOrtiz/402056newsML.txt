National Westminster Bank Plc on Tuesday reported a jump in operating profit but the bank's shares dipped after it warned of an economic slowdown in 1998 and did not perform an expected share repurchase.
Underlying profit rose by 27 percent and NatWest, one of Britain's biggest banks, said the headline profits figure was hit by one-off items.
Profit before tax was 1.12 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) after exceptional items, with operating profit from continuing operations up by 339 million to 1.61 billion pounds.
The bank said it expected the pace of  British economic growth to slow in 1998, however, and as a consequence was adopting a more cautious approach to lending.
"We don't want people to get carried away by 3.5 percent (economic ) growth this year which is what me might still see," NatWest chief executive Derek Wanless told Reuters in an interview.
"Our belief is that whoever wins the election, rates will rise and the fiscal position could well be tighter."
He added that NatWest was putting the lending policies in place now for people who will be paying back in that economic climate.
Wanless said NatWest expected British base rates to rise to 7-1/4 percent by the end of the year compared to their current six percent level.
NatWest increased its general provisions against bad debts by 50 million pounds and made specific provisions of 499 million pounds.
Analysts said the market would be disappointed that NatWest had not performed a further repurchase of shares following its 451 million pounds buyback last July.
Wanless said NatWest will perform further share repurchases if it generates more surplus capital.
Some analysts had expected NatWest to use its remaining shareholder authority to buy back 28 million shares which would have cost it some 220 million pounds but the bank made no announcement.
"If we've got surplus capital we will return it to shareholders," Wanless said. "That's still the policy and will remain the policy."
He said NatWest would ask shareholders to return its buy-back mandate to 100 million shares at its AGM in April but declined to give any clues on when a repurchase might actually be performed.
NatWest's pre-tax profit figure came after a loss of 719 million pounds on sale of businesses such as its U.S. banking operation Bancorp, costs of 186 million on the redesign of its UK retail bank and a gain of 224 million on the sale of its stake in venture capital company 3i.
Pre-tax profits at NatWest Markets, its investment banking arm, rose to 462 million pounds from 304 million, although this included a fall in bad debt provisions to 18 million pounds from 114 million.
Wanless said the group would not bid in the auction currently under way for mutually-owned life insurer Scottish Amicable but added that it was still on the look out to bolster its operations in the area of long-term savings.
Wanless said NatWest UK saw a six percent rise in income and a two percent fall in costs despite the fact that it was spending large amounts on new systems.
He said an additional 100 million pounds would be spent on this in 1997.
NatWest is paying a final dividend of 19.4 pence, raising the total for the year by 14.6 percent to 29.0p.
By 1130 GMT, NatWest shares were 25-1/2 pence lower at 787 having rallying from a low earlier of 762. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds)
