Office Depot stopped building superstores when it agreed to merge with Staples Inc and will have to scramble to regain its footing if it remains alone, industry analysts said on Friday.
"They need to circle the wagons and begin rebuilding management and decide what kind of company they want to be," said Mark Mandel of The Chicago Corp. "They've lost lots of momentum."  
The deal to combine Staples and Office Depot, reached in September, would have created a dominant force in office-supply retailing with about 1,000 stores. Rival OfficeMax has between 700 and 800 superstores.
But federal regulators earlier on Friday struck a blow that was potentially fatal to the transaction, saying such a combination would cripple price competition for office supplies in some markets.
The companies denounced the decision by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Staples chief executive Thomas Stemberg told reporters Staples may challenge the FTC ruling in court.  
"Computer sales collapsed and paper prices were deflating but their margins held up," McMullin said. "And the infrastructure's in place."
But McMullin said the rejection by the FTC and the prospect of a court battle were clouding Office Depot's outlook.
Staples shares rose after the FTC ruling and closed at 21-7/8, or 5/8 higher. Office Depot shares dropped 6 to 13, after having fallen as low as 12, or roughly the price at which they were trading before the September merger announcement.
"Staples is up and Office Depot is down. If they were going to get together, you'd expect more harmony," McMullin said.
