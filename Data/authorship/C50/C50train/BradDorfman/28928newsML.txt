Magna Group Inc's planned acquisition of Homeland Bankshares Corp is not likely to alter the St. Louis-based bank holding company's own potential to be acquired, analysts said.
"It certainly doesn't make them any less attractive or likely as a takeover candidate," said Steven Schroll, a banking industry analyst at Piper Jaffray.
Magna is among several Missouri-based banks considered by analysts to be likely acquisition targets.  
"I don't think it probably changes the company either way too much" in terms of takeover prospects, said Joseph Stieven, a banking analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.
Still, with Iowa's limit on how much of the state's total deposits a single banking company can hold, Magna's acquisition of Iowa-based Homeland could prevent some potential buyers from swallowing up Magna, analysts noted.
"It could complicate it, because Iowa does have relatively low state cap," Stieven said. "But it doesn't necessarily mean it was done as a defensive measure."  
Schroll's initial reading of the proposed deal is that it will add to Magna's earnings in 1997, the year the deal is expected to close.
"We believe it could be 15 cents accretive, maybe more," Schroll said, cautioning that this was a preliminary view of the deal.
Magna said in a news release the deal would be accretive within 12 months.
Other analysts noted that Homeland has a relatively high ratio of equity to assets and said paying about 1.65 times book value for Homeland might be a bit expensive. Homeland's ratio of equity to assets was 10.79 percent in the second quarter.
The price of "165 (percent) of book could be pretty generous if you've got an overcapitalized bank," said Ben Crabtree, banking analyst at Dain Bosworth.
"It sounds like a pretty big price," agreed Stieven.
Magna was down 1/4 at 24-1/2 Monday afternoon, while Homeland was up 2-1/4 at 36-1/4.
