Cascade Communications Corp said its core frame-relay business continued to grow in 1996 at the hyper-growth rates seen in recent years, but that some of the evidence of this was concealed in its other businesses.
In a phone interview, chief executive Daniel Smith said some frame-relay business is now concealed in sales of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) products, a newer line of high-speed data transmission products Cascade sells.
Smith also said he sees Cascade gaining frame-relay market share in 1997, but at perhaps a slower pace than to date.  
"We grew market share significantly in 1996 and we expect to continue that in 1997, but maybe at a slower rate than in 1996," he told Reuters. He declined to quantify these growth goals saying it was company policy not to make such forecasts.
He said Cascade had "relatively flat" sequential frame relay sales in the fourth quarter, compared with its September quarter, but attributed this to delays in telecom customer orders, not lost business.  
Cascade stock fell sharply Friday following the release of its fourth quarter earnings late Thursday, which were slightly better-than-expected. By late afternoon Friday, Cascade stock had fallen 23-1/8 to 41 on volume of nearly 39 million shares.
Fourth quarter net income was $0.24 per share, a penny ahead of consensus, versus $0.10 in the 1995 fourth quarter.
