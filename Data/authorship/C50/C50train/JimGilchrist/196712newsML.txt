Landing fees at Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok airport must be competitively priced compared to other airports in the region, the chairman of Cathay Pacific Airways Limited Peter Sutch said.
Reports of fees double those at Kai Tak airport have already caused alarm among airlines and representative groups such as the Orient Airlines Association.
As one of the main users of the new airport, industry observers say Cathay managers are especially concerned about the level of the new fees which will heavily influence long term profitability.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) Users' Group is one group closely watching the situation, Sutch noted at the ceremonial start of work on Cathay's new headquarters at the site of the new airport.
"As airlines compete against each other, so do airports such as Taipei, Singapore and Bangkok's new airport. It is important for the industry and the economy of Hong Kong that the airport is competitive for its users," Sutch said.
A spokesman for the Airport Authority, the body set up to manage Chek Lap Kok said the consultation process is still going on and the fee structure is expected to be revealed in the first or second quarter of next year.
Sutch said Cathay is considering raising passenger ticket prices and air cargo rates because of increased fuel costs.
"We are seriously considering reducing some of the increased fuel cost through higher ticket prices and cargo rates. As soon as a decision is made we will let you know," he said.
Airlines belonging to IATA agreed on Friday on a three per cent rise in air fares to cover higher fuel bills. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
