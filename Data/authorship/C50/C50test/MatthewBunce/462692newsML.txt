Port arrivals of 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) Ivorian coffee totalled about 150,000 tonnes by March 16 compared to about 110,000 tonnes in 1995/96 despite doubts over quality, exporters said.
"It is a larger crop than last year," said one industry buyer. "The figures tie in with forecasts of upwards of 230,000 tonnes but as with last year marketing has been left a little later because of a large cocoa crop."
Ivory Coast produced around 180,000 tonnes of mainly robusta coffee in 1995/96 and has slated 230,000 tonnes for 1996/97.
A mild January-March flowering period in early 1996 and a peak in the strong-moderate-weak production cycle had helped boost the 1996/97 harvest, crop analysts said.
Exporters said 120,000 tonnes had been taken to Abidjan and 30,000 to Ivory Coast's second port, San Pedro, since the season opened in mid-November.
Port sources put coffee exports to mid-March at little over 40,000 tonnes as sorting and grading had slowed port throughput, leaving warehouse stocks of around 100,000 tonnes.
"Trade is still talking about 230,000 tonnes to 300,000 tonnes but even 230,000 tonnes is big for Ivory Coast," said one. "Exports are still low so stocks have built up."
Large volumes of cocoa had reduced available warehouse space from December until a wave of shipments against March contracts, exporters said in February.
Coffee marketing usually picks up from Janaury as cocoa arrivals fall.
One port source said quality problems meant that not more than 150,000 tonnes would be exported in 1996/97, but others disagreed.
"There is now a lot of buying of all grades but the coffee is taking a long time to prepare for export," he added.
Yields per hectare had risen this year -- with one plantation manager citing 600 kilos per hectare compared to 400 last year -- but grading was taking much longer.
Exporters who fund upcountry purchases to meet export contracts (Oct-Sept year) said careless harvesting and poor sorting continued to be a problem.
Markets were now being found for lower grades after a world price rally followed a slump in late 1996, exporters said.
"Everything will find a way out so nothing will be wasted. Some will be sent out to eastern Europe or other such markets," said one. "There are possiblities for black beans (sub-grade) but you never know what arrangement people have been able to make."
Crop analysts recently touring upcountry farms said village farmers' wives were still busy winnowing large volumes of coffee initially rejected by upcountry buyers.
Farm union officials said coffee had had been badly stored after rains hampered drying in December. Some cooperatives were still short of sacks for sending coffee to ports, one said.
