Selling motorcycles used to be a joy ride for the giant, military-founded China Jialing Industrial Co Ltd, but then it ran into real market competition and growth slowed down sharply.
"Up until 1995, we sold as much as we produced," said Tian Min, deputy director of financial affairs at the Shanghai-listed firm, in which the Chinese government has a 75 percent stake.
But Jialing, China's biggest motorcycle manufacturer and a former munitions manufacturer that began making civilian products in 1979, saw rival manufacturers mushroom across China in 1994 and 1995 to cash in on its market.
Cutthroat competition slashed prices and profits and swelled stockpiles last year.
"In 1996, we could not sell what we produced," Tian said in an interview at Jialing's headquarters in China's wartime capital of Chongqing in southwestern Sichuan province.
Jialing's sales plunged to 3.5 billion yuan ($421.7 million) in 1996 from 4.6 billion yuan in 1995. After-tax profits tumbled to 270 million yuan in 1996 from 460 million yuan in 1995.
"Sales in 1994 and 1995 were good and many seeing this jumped aboard," Tian said.
China has about 300 motorcycle plants with total annual production capacity of 20 million units, but only 10 make more than 100,000 a year.
China is the world's largest motorcycle maker, churning out 7.83 million units in 1995, but selling only 6.1 million.
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has called for moves to curb blind investment in industries that appear profitable.
Blind investment is being repeated in many sectors, such as colour televisions, washing machines and refrigerators. Production has outstripped demand, leading to overheated competition, price wars and mounting losses among state firms.
Adding to the problems of motorcycle manufacturers, some regional governments, alarmed at traffic congestion and air pollution, have discouraged motorcycle purchases by curbing the issue of licence plates.
TIGHT MONETARY POLICY TO BLAME
Tian also blamed the company's woes on the government's tight monetary policy to rein in galloping inflation.
"The motorcycle market shrank...because people have less money...and less buying power," he said.
Tight monetary policy has also resulted in triangular debt, or debt owed among state-owned firms, and cash flow problems.
"Debts owed to each other are very serious...We can't get our money back for motorcycles sold," Tian said.
Jialing's collectibles soared to 700 million yuan in 1996.
The company has formed debt collection squads and aims to reduce collectibles to 300 million yuan by end-1997. Collectibles were virtually non-existent in 1994.
STRUGGLING TO REMAIN NUMBER ONE
The climb to the top is hard. Staying on top is even harder.
A price war has forced Jialing to slash prices by an average of 13 percent in 1997, Tian said. The price cut was expected to reduce sales by 400 million yuan a year.
Sales staff would receive commissions linked to performance instead of a fixed salary to try to increase sales, he said.
Jialing will curb waste and cut stockpiles, now 80,000-90,000. It is inviting tenders to force competition among parts suppliers and expects to save 300 million yuan in 1997.
Its motorcycle engines are produced at a joint venture plant with Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd.
Sales were forecast to hit 4.2 billion yuan in 1997, while profits would be "no lower" than in 1996, Tian said.
Jialing would produce 1.35 million motorcycles in 1997 from 1.13 million in 1996. It has capacity for 1.7 million.
Its 1995 output of 1.1085 million motorcycles accounted for 14 percent of the national total of 7.83 million. Jialing's output was forecast to hit two million in the year 2000.
AMBITIONS RISE BEYOND MOTORCYCLES
Jialing has ambitions to do more than produce motorcycles.
It has applied to issue H shares in Hong Kong to raise funds to expand into car production, financing and pharmaceuticals.
The company wants to set up a non-bank financial institution to finance motorcycle sales, Tian said.
To meet the challenges of China's fledgling market economy, Jialing, like many state enterprises, must tackle overstaffing and the burden of cradle-to-grave welfare for its employees.
Jialing plans to lay off about one percent of its 12,500 employees in 1997, with the accumulated figure hitting 3,000 in the year 2000, Tian said.
"We're not like capitalist countries...we can't just abandon them," Tian said. "We have to help them to find new jobs...or it'll bring problems to our social order and stability."
