Gareth Davies, chief executive of British cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco, which de-merged from conglomerate Hanson in October, said on Thursday it was difficult to see growth in Britain, although it hoped to make this up by expansion in the Asia- Pacific region.
"In Britian it is difficult to see the market growing given the punitive taxes. We are likely to see continued strong growth, though, in the Asia Pacific area of the world," he said.  
Earlier, Imperial posted profits of 303 million stg from Britain in the year ended September 28, unchanged from its 1995 level but profits from overseas grew 55 percent to 70 million.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, announced an increase of 15p on a packet of 20 cigarettes in his November Budget. After a similar rise in 1995, British cigarette sales fell by 2.5 percent to 81 billion.
Davies said he expected the same sort of fall again. He said the latest tax rise would fuel smuggling by widening further the gap between taxes in Britain and mainland Europe.
