    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means that it treats every piece of data like some kind of object that can be manipulated and passed around. Python has the following **basic types of objects**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **String**: for representing text.\n",
    "* **Integer**: for representing whole numbers.\n",
    "* **Float**: for representing numbers with decimals.\n",
    "* **Tuple**: for representing immutable combinations of values.\n",
    "* **List**: for representing ordered sequences of objects.\n",
    "* **Set**: for representing unordered sets of objects.\n",
    "* **Dictionary**: to represent mappings between objects.\n",
    "* **Booleans**: too represent the truth values `True` or `False`.\n",
    "* ..and **functions**: to manipulate objects, or to produce new objects given some input.\n",
    "\n",

When something is of a numeric type (integer, float), the Python interpreter knows that you can perform mathematical operations with that object. You cannot use those operations with strings, because it doesn't make sense to take the square root of the string \"Hello, world!\".\n",
