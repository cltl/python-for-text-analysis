The Czech trade deficit for December widened beyond forecasts, but analysts said the crown should hold steady on Monday despite some nervous moments immediately after the figures were released.
The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said the trade deficit for December hit 18.0 billion crowns ($650 million), putting the full year 1996 shortfall at a record 160.33 billion crowns.
A Reuters survey of economists had forecast a December deficit of about 16 billion crowns, following a 14.3 billion crown trade gap for the same month in the previous year. The overall 1995 deficit was 95.7 billion crowns.
The CSU said in a statement that imports for 1996, spurred by constant growth of machinery imports, totalled 755.3 billion crowns, a year-on-year rise of 12.7 percent.
Meanwhile, the CSU said exports faltered, hampered in part by a downturn in western European economies and a strengthening crown, rising only 3.5 percent year-on-year to total 594.95 billion crowns in 1996.
The CSU added that machinery imports alone for the year hit 288.5 billion crowns, an increase of 16.1 percent over 1995.
Raw materials, unprocessed goods and chemical products imports also showed strong growth, totalling 327.9 billion crowns, a 10.2 percent year-on-year increase.
The same sector also dominated exports, reaching 280.6 billion crowns. But the CSU said exports in this area contracted by some 4.2 percent year-on-year.
Despite the poorer than expected result for December, analysts said the overall figure should have little impact on the crown after some nervous moments in early Monday trading.
"It's quite nervous, spreads are wide...(but) bad figures were expected and the figures are not seasonally adjusted," said Petr Tomek of Zivnostenska Banka.
The crown dipped to around 27.888 against the dollar and 17.057 against the mark implying +4.07 percent against its mark/dollar basket mid-point immediately after the figures were released, but it subsequently recovered to around +4.2 percent.
The crown was fixed on Friday by the central bank at 4.4 percent above the basket mid-point. ($1=27.84 Czech Crown)
