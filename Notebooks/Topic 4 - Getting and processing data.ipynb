    "This week, we will cover the topic of getting and processing data. Given a research problem, where can you find the relevant data? How do you obtain the data? And how do you actually process the data? This notebook aims to guide you through the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**At the end of this week, you will be able to:**\n",
    "- Get data from the web using an API or the `requests` library.\n",
    "- Process data from the web using different tools.\n",
    "- Use generator functions.\n",
    "- Use `try` and `except` to handle errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This requires that you already have (some) knowledge about:**\n",
    "- JSON files\n",
    "- files, loops and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you want to learn more about these topics, you might find the following links useful:**\n",
    "- Video: [Loop like a native](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Please install the following modules before class. For this, you'll need to use the command line environment. On a Mac, use the Terminal application. On Windows, use cmd ([see this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EohzkYPV6nI)).\n",

    "The difference between these two is that in the former, you check whether it's OK to execute the first bit of code before actually going ahead and running it. This is called the \"look before you leap\" coding style ([LBYL](https://docs.python.org/3.6/glossary.html#term-lbyl)). The alternative is to just run the code, and see if it breaks down. If the code breaks down, then you execute some other piece of code.

    "* How often does the exception happen? If the exception is common, then using the if-statement is better. But if exceptions are rare, then it's better to just run the code and catch the error with the `except`-statement. (Else you'd be performing loads of unnecessary checks.)\n",
    "* How costly is the operation that might give you an error? If it's a very heavy operation, you might want to make sure whether it's OK to run it in the first place. But if the operation is very light, then that's not a very big issue.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Browser (loads of data available online)\n",
    "* Command line: `wget` ([manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html))\n",
    "* Python: `requests`, `urllib`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see some dataset online, or you just want to download a webpage, there is no better way than to use your browser and either save the page (from the File menu), or to right-click and press \"save as..\". But for more complex cases, you'll want to automate the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The command line `wget` tool is like a swiss pocket knife for downloading stuff in bulk. For example, if you have a list of URLs in a text file called `list_of_urls.txt`, you can just use `wget -i list_of_urls.txt` to download all the files. You can also use the `wget` module in Python. For more complicated procedures, it's easier to just use the `requests` or `urllib` library. The `wget` tool is also [available on Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm). We won't explore `wget` in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how we downloaded the Linguist List data for this course (we'll use this data later on):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import urllib.request\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "base_url = 'http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/linglite/'\n",
    "years = [str(year) for year in range(1997,2016)]\n",
    "months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',\n",
    "          'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']\n",
    "\n",
    "for year in years:\n",
    "    # OS-independent way of creating the path to the folder.\n",
    "    path = os.path.join('..', 'linguistlist', year)\n",
    "    # Make the necessary folder.\n",
    "    os.makedirs(path)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for month in months:\n",

    "        filename = '{}-{}.txt.gz'.format(year, month)\n",
    "        path_with_file = os.path.join(path, filename)\n",
    "        url = base_url + filename\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Write the data to disk.\n",
    "        with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response:\n",

    "            with open(path_with_file, 'wb') as outfile:\n",
    "                data = response.read()\n",

    "\n",
    "How did we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, we went to the [Linguist List archive website](http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/linglite/). The archive looks nice, but it's a lot of work to download all of those files by hand!\n",
    "* Then, we inspected the **source** of the webpage. In Firefox, you can do this by going to `Tools/Developer/Page Source`. In Chrome: `View/Developer/View Source`. Most other browsers offer this functionality as well.\n",
    "* We saw that the URLs for the monthly archives are very regular. This is good, it means that we can exploit this regularity.\n",
    "* Then, we decided on a local structure: we want to have one folder for every year, in which all the archives for that year are stored. This structure determined the structure of our program.\n",
    "* If you don't download files often, search online for a good way to do this. Many programmers would be lost without Google/StackOverflow! The first thing we found was the `urllib` library. But a solution using the `requests` library would also be OK! That would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the data:\n",
    "r = requests.get('http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/linglite/2016-September.txt.gz')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the 'wb' flag because the response contents are bytes.\n",
    "with open('September.txt.gz','wb') as f:\n",
    "\t# Write the data:\n",
    "\tf.write(r.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's good practice to make your computer wait a little between requests. So we used the `sleep` function from the `time` module to wait 2 seconds after each download."

You can get the un-compressed `.txt` file by unpacking the `.txt.gz` file, but there's also a useful Python module called `gzip` that lets you inspect these files ([documentation here](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/gzip.html)). \n",

    "### Using an API\n",
    "\n",
    "An API (*application programming interface*) provides a way for programs to interact with applications running independently. Those applications could either be running on your own computer, or they could be running somewhere else. We will be working with online APIs, specifically APIs providing the interface to some database. \n",
    "\n",
    "General guidelines for using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to minimize the number of requests you make. Can you be selective before putting in your requests? \n",
    "2. Try to spread your requests so that you don't overload the server.\n",
    "3. Try to cache your results so that you don't request the same thing twice. (Think about multiple sessions and testing your code.)\n",

    "In short: developers providing APIs are doing us a favor. Acting nice to them is the least we can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bare APIs and wrappers\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs work like this: you send them a request (possibly with some additional information), and they send you the relevant data back. Sometimes you have to send these requests explicitly in your code, but other times there will be a *wrapper* where people have written code to provide a nice interface for you to use.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Please run the code below. Is there anything surprising about the output? \n",
    "* If you speak German, Dutch, Hungarian, French, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Turkish, or Spanish, you could try running Spotlight for any of those languages as well. See the [documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyspotlight/0.7.1) for the list of ports in the demo server. Change `2222` below to the relevant port, and you can run Spotlight for your language!"
