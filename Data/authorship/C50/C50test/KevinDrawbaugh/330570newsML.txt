Jones Medical Industries Inc chief executive Dennis Jones said Friday in an interview that he is comfortable with the First Call consensus earnings forecast of $0.23 per share for the fourth quarter.
"That $0.23, I'm comfortable with that," Jones told Reuters. "Which puts it at $0.79 for the year."
St. Louis-based Jones earned $0.16 per share, as restated for a three-million-share pooling acquisition of privately held Daniels Pharmaceuticals, in the fourth quarter a year ago and $0.50 per share in all of 1995, Jones said.  
Shares in Jones were down 1-1/4 to 31-3/4 on heavy trading, extending a bumpy week for the drug company.
"It's huge volume, unbelievable," Jones said. "I guess they're trying to find out what the valuation should be."
Throughout last year, Jones' stock price was extremely volatile, starting 1996 near 10, climbing through the summer to 50 by September, then sliding in the past four months.
Earlier, institutional holding of the stock had grown to over 50 percent from 15 percent of total outstanding shares, Jones said. "Of those, a lot of them were momentum players, and it looks like they've lightened up," he said.  
The company expects to report year-end financial results in the second week of February, Jones said.
Jones has made four acquisitions since August, 1995. The company focuses on buying products from large pharmaceutical companies or others that have somehow not lived up to their sales potential, and breathing new life into them.
"I would like to keep that pace going. We have the ability financially and I think we have the ability from a management perspective ... We're sitting on $45 million in cash, essentially no debt and I think about $100 million of debt capacity," Jones said.
