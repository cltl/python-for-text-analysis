Czech blue chip shares closed mostly higher on the Prague Stock Exchange on Wednesday, helping spur the bourse to its third consecutive advancing session.
CEZ, Komercni Banka, Chemopetrol and Ceska Sporitelna all gained ground to boost the PX50 index 3.1 points, or 0.57 percent, to 550.4. Overall, 184 of the 375 issues trading gained ground, while 131 lost and 60 held steady.
CEZ, which crossed the 1,000 barrier on Tuesday for the first time since October, moved further ahead with a 13 crown rise to 1,024. Komercni Banka closed up 56 crowns at 2,356 and Chemopetrol gained 27 crowns to 1,200.
Tobacco company Tabak continued its uptrend with a 43 crown gain to 7,050.
Brewers Prazske Pivovary and Pivovar Radegast both record strong sessions, rising 55 crowns and 83 crowns respectively on the heels of British brewer Bass's announcement that it had increased its stake in Radegast by 10 percent to 33 percent.
Bass's Czech country manager, Mervyn Childs, said the British firm wants to further raise its stake in Radegast and set up a possible merger with Prazske in which it holds a majority stake.
"In the medium to longer term we would like to increase our stake (in Radegast) but we'll do that hopefully through discussion and agreement with other major shareholders," Childs told Reuters.
"In the medium to longer term yes we would like to consider a merger of Radegast and Prague Breweries group," he added.
Analysts said Bass's announcement could push both issues higher in the coming weeks, as investors look to cash in on Bass's hunger to expand in the sector.
"Bass appears to be serious about raising its stakes, especially in Radegast, and this could add as much as five percent to its share price," said one analyst.
