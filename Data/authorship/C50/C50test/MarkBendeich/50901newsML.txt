Industrial conglomerate Pacific Dunlop Ltd will announce another heavy fall in annual net profit on Friday, with abnormal losses possibly sinking the bottom line into red ink, stock analysts said on Thursday.
PacDun, dogged by litigation over problems with its U.S.-made cardiac implants and by weak economic growth at home and abroad, has already softened the blow by warning investors last May that annual profit would be 35 percent lower.  
The warning pared forecasts of pre-abnormal net profit down to an average of A$162 million for the year to June 30, said BZW Investment Management's BARCEPS forecasting service.
This compares with a 1994/95 pre-abnormal result of A$251 million and a first-half pre-abnormal result of A$118 million.
But the group -- a major international producer of rubber consumer goods, car batteries and tyres, industrial cables and clothing -- is likely to book a large net abnormal loss of up to A$300 million, Macquarie Equities analyst Greg Dring said.  
Pacific Dunlop's troubled U.S. medical equipment unit, Telectronics, which accounted for A$60.5 million in abnormal losses in 1994/1995, will again incur big provisions for costs associated with its pacemaker leads, he said.
Dring estimated that these provisions could account in 1995/96 for about A$200 million of a total net abnormal loss estimated at up to A$300 million, he added. He said he assumed the group would not book a tax benefit on these losses.
