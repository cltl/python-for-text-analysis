Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd has opened a new cargo office in Auckland, New Zealand, according to the airline's in-house newspaper.
It said Cathay's cargo operations in New Zealand are growing fast following expansion of services from two to five flights a week between Hong Kong and Auckland over the past two years.
Auckland's cargo sales supervisor, Louise McNeil is quoted as saying the increased capacity means Cathay can carry a wider range of goods as well as help develop the long-haul market beyond Hong Kong. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017
