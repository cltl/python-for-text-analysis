Small capitalization technology stocks shrugged off a wave of profit-taking that socked blue chip stocks Monday as investors shopped for values among beaten- down or lesser known names, especially in the Internet sector.
"Some of the second- and third-tier technology names have become the focus," agreed Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.  
Among the beneficiaries of this broadening interest in technology stocks were America Online Inc, up 4-1/8 to 39-1/2 and Adobe Systems Inc, up 2-1/4 to 41-3/4.
Informix Corp was the most actively traded issue on the Nasdaq, gaining 1-1/4 to 25 by mid-afternoon Monday, following reports that its next-generation Universal Server database has the edge over rival Oracle Corp.
Other strong gainers included Netscape Communications Corp, which rose 2-1/8 to 58 and electronic payment company CyberCash Inc, which gained 2-7/8 to 28-1/8.  
"We are stepping down the liquidity and quality ladder," said Paul Rabbit, Oppenheimer's chief portfolio strategist. "(Investors) are trying to find some of the beat up ones," he said, adding, "There is a search for less exploited areas."
"Today is the first (trading) day of a new month and there appears to be a little profit taking here, but it doesn't appear to be affecting the technology stocks," Bleier said.
Analysts said investors were shying from bellwethers Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp following their strong run-up in November, even as International Business Machines Corp hit a new year-high.  
Intel was down 1-1/8 to 125-3/4 on volume of nearly five million shares, while Microsoft shed 1-1/4 to 155-5/8. Both stocks remain near historic price levels. The Dow Jones composite index was off 41.74 to 6479.96.
