Czech telephone operator SPT Telecom a.s. on Thursday reported a nine-month gross profit of 6.0 billion crowns, in line with forecasts, and said outlays for investment rose significantly in the period.
"The figures were basically in line with our estimates. Margins are pretty much the same as they were in the first half so I think the company is in a good position for future growth," said Alex Marcek an analyst at Patria Finance.
The company's gross profit for all of 1995 was 7.0 billion crowns. SPT used International Accounting Standards in calculating its profit.
In a statement, the company said revenues  totalled 23.3 billion crowns, nearly equal to the 26.4 billion crowns for 1995.
SPT said outlays for investment in the nine-month period exceeded 20 billion crowns or more than the total for 1995.
A Dutch-Swiss consortium of PTT Netherlands and Swiss Telecom, which bought a 27 percent stake in SPT from the government last summer, has effective day-to-day control of the firm. The consortium paid $1.32 billion for its stake.
SPT said it installed more telephone lines in the Czech Republic in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date figure to 272,000 lines. SPT now has a total of 2.67 million lines.
"The company is confident that it will achieve its 1996 target of over 400,000 new set lines," the statement said. The company is aiming to increase its network by another 500,000 lines in 1997, and 650,000 in 1998.
SPT is the only telephone line operator in the country. There are also two GSM mobile phone operators, but they do not install hard lines.
"If they hit the target of 400,000 new lines it would be a pretty good base as far as revenues are concerned," said one local telecom analyst.
SPT shares closed down six crowns at 2,879 in after-bourse trading in Prague.
The company didn't comment on its dividend policy. SPT has said in the past that it doesn't plan to pay a dividend before 1998.
