Canada's Trade Minister Art Eggleton is in good health and will leave Tuesday night for an international conference in Manila, despite being taken to hospital earlier Tuesday after he collapsed at a meeting here.
"The last thing I heard was he's still going to Manila," Eggleton's spokeswoman Elaine McArdle told Reuters by telephone from in Ottawa. "His health is great. It doesn't appear that anything is broken."  
Speakers had just finished addressing a luncheon audience of businessmen and trade officials at Toronto's Westin Harbour Castle Hotel when Eggleton, 53, tripped as he got up to leave the head table.
"There was a gap in the floorboards and he went right through them," McArdle said.
Other dignitaries helped Eggleton, pale and shaky, to a chair where he waited with his head resting on a table until ambulance attendants arrived. The attendants strapped on an oxygen mask and carried Eggleton out on a stretcher.  
Witnesses said he twisted his ankle as he fell and landed on his knee.
Eggleton had been expected to speak at the luncheon with Chilean President Eduardo Frei. Canada and Chile signed a free trade pact in Ottawa on Monday.
Eggleton plans to leave for Manila on Tuesday night for the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) annual meeting and leaders summit.
He is scheduled to accompany Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien to China and Japan after the APEC conference.
