HONG KONG, Dec 10 (Reuter) Polar Air Cargo is cutting the number of freighters it operates from Hong Kong to the U.S. until the end of the month as the trans-Pacific market is now winding down after a busy peak season, the all cargo airline's Hong Kong sales manager, David Sung.
From Monday December 16, Polar will only operate one or two Boeing 747 freighters to the U.S. east coast, instead of its usual five flights per week.
Sung told Reuters in an interview ex-Hong Kong trans Pacific rates are also reducing at the rate of five U.S. cents per week until the end of the month as demand for cargo space falls because most goods have already reached the U.S. Christmas market.
"For every week after the end of November we see an 8-10 percent drop in demand as the market steps down from the peak period. We will be adjusting our schedule from next week and reducing the number of flights from five to one or two until the end of the month. Recently all our flights have been full - the best peak period for the past five years in Hong Kong - but now demand is dropping off," he said. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
