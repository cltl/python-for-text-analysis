Air China, China's largest carrier, plans to increase its international routes next year and will boost its fleet with the addition of five passenger planes, a senior manager said on Wednesday.
"We would be concentrating on expanding our international routes within the ninth five-year plan (1996-2000)," said Zhang Jinming, general manager of the airline's publicity centre, told Reuters at the China Airshow '96.
The carrier would be starting flights from Beijing and Shanghai to Los Angeles on June 29, 1997, and planned to start routes next year from Beijing to Fushan in South Korea and to Brazil, Zhang said.
The five-day airshow at Zhuhai airport in southern Guangdong province is touted as China's largest and costliest aviation and aerospace exhibition to date, bringing together domestic and foreign aircraft and parts producers.
Increasing demand for domestic and international travel since the start of rapid economic reforms has also boosted China's civil aviation industry. The country now has 30 passenger carriers.
Air China, established in 1955 and China's longest-running carrier, currently flies 44 international and domestic routes, Zhang said.
Flights from China to Los Angeles would either be two or three times a week, he said, adding that the launch dates for service to South Korea and Brazil have yet to be finalised.
The airline, which has a fleet of 64 Boeing passenger jets, would also be taking delivery of three Airbus A340 passenger planes and two Boeing 747s in 1997, Zhang said.
Zhang said the proliferation of Chinese carriers in recent years had given way to cut-throat competition.
"Because of competition, some companies have slashed prices. For us, we have cut by similar amounts, " he said. But he added that the company, given its long and proven track record, was more keen to conduct business based on reputation.
