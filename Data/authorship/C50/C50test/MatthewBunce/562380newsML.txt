Rains continued across Ivory Coast's cocoa belt in late April, confirming the onset of wet season patterns and boosting mid-crop (May-Sept) and early 1996/97 main crop (Oct-April) prospects, weather and crop analysts said on Tuesday.
"A favourable weather pattern developed in April with strengthening rains in many areas," said one weather analyst, adding that a band of rain usually sitting 200 km south of the region's tropical weather front was now over cocoa areas.
"There have been some heavy rains but so far the flowers (for the 1997/98 maincrop) have held on," said one crop analyst.
Official rainfall data for the third 10 days of April totalled 789.2 mm against 693.5 mm in the previous 10 days and 95.2 mm for the first 10 days of the month.
Rains fell mainly in south coast areas between Abidjan and Tabou but steady rains also fell in other key growing areas around Gagnoa. Rains were lightest in northern areas.
One crop analyst put overall 1997 rainfall at just below average but said end-April rains were likely to have brought levels back to average.
Another said rains had risen to 145 mm against his 10-year average figure of 134 mm for 12 stations. Rains in some areas had been 35-145 percent above normal.
A dry period in February threatened to cut prospects for the mid-crop but subsequent rains allowed pod forecasters to upgrade forecasts for the period to a range of 160-180,000 tonnes -- compared to 200,000 tonnes last year.
Crop analysts now expect the total 1996/97 cocoa crop to be near last year's record of 1.2 million tonnes. Ivory Coast has not revised its original total crop forecast of 950,000 tonnes.
Latest figures for the 1996/97 main crop, which ended on April 30, have not been released but are expected by exporters and crop analysts to show port arrivals of just over one million tonnes.
This year's mid-crop depends partly on steady rains into June -- when forecasters also begin early assessments of cocoa trees for the 1997/98 main crop.
Latest data from Ivory Coast's national weather station showed the following rainfall (mm) for the first 10 days of April in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days in brackets):
Daloa 21.8 (49.3), Gagnoa 62.7 (63.7), San Pedro 49.4 (47.1), Tabou 95.4 (57.0) Man 12.5 (29.3), Dimbokro 41.8 (22.2), Yamoussoukro 69.0 (107.7), Abidjan 221.2 (156.5), Sassandra 154.7 (39.1), Adiake 51.7 (69.9), Korhogo 9.0 (51.7).
