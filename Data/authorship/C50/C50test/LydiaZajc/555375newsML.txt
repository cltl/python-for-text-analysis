Toronto's key stock index rocketed almost 100 points higher on Friday as earnings euphoria soared and fears of a U.S. interest rate hike waned.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index climbed 97.01 points to 6106.91 and extended its winning streak to a fourth day.
Trading in Canada's largest equities market totaled 109 million shares worth C$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion).
"All of a sudden people are coming back to rational expectations," said Calgary, Alberta-based portfolio manager Josef Schachter. "Earnings have been fantastic."
Stock market gains in Toronto and New York were also powered by news of a long-awaited agreement between the White House and congressional Republican leaders to balance the U.S. budget, Schachter said.
A balanced U.S. budget means the government will offer fewer bonds, boosting demand and prices for fixed income instruments and reducing yields.
There were also growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would not hike interest rates at its May 20 meeting since this week's U.S. economic data pointed to minimal inflation growth.
This week, Toronto's key index jumped by almost five percent as strong corporate earnings rolled in.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 12 rose on Friday, including media, utilities, consumer products and banks. Real estate and gold groups slipped.
Advancing issues led decliners 616 to 358, while 254 were unchanged.
In individual issues, telecommunications conglomerate BCE Inc. jumped 4.20 to 69.95. Cable and telephone companies were active after the federal Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on Thursday threw the country's local telephone market open to competition.
The government telecommunications watchdog also came out in favor of convergence between the phone and cable television broadcast industries.
Bank of Montreal, Canada's third largest, jumped 1.70 to 53.75, leading interest-sensitive banks.
