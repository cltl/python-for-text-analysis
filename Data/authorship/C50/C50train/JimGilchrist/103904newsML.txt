Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair) is about to buy two new Airbus Industrie consortium aircraft and lease another to cope with increasing demand on its routes into China, industry sources told Reuters.
The proposed deal is for two new Airbus A320 aircraft for delivery in 1998 and 1999 with options for five more and one larger Airbus A330 on lease from next year, the source said.
A Dragonair spokesman said it could not confirm the reported acquisition but he said talks on new aircraft had been taking place.
The airline which currently has a fleet of seven Airbus A320s and four A330s, recently said it will need additional aircraft.
"It is common knowledge that we have a requirement for extra capacity and we have been talking to Airbus but no announcement has been made yet," the spokesman said.
Industry analysts said expansion would be seen as a vote of confidence in future business prospects after a difficult period trying to develop its regional network especially into China.
Slot restrictions at Hong Kong's crowded Kai Tak airport were a major constraint, they added.
Expansion would also benefit Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd which holds an 18 percent stake in the regional carrier by feeding more passengers and cargo on its international network and vice versa, analysts said.
Dragonair recently began new services to the Chinese city of Qingdao and Khaohsiung in Taiwan. It also has full scheduled cargo rights on two of its Chinese routes to Xian and Chengdu and says it has plans for additional Chinese services to Chongqing, Urumqi and Shantou.
Other shareholders in Dragonair are the Chinese state-owned China National Aviation Corp with 36 percent, China-backed CITIC Pacific Ltd with 29 percent and Cathay's parent, Swire Pacific Ltd with eight percent. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017
