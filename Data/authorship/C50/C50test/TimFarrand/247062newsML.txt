Food service company Compass Group still has plenty of growth potential to come from the global trend towards contracting out catering, said chief executive Francis Mackay in an interview.
"There is a natural and gradual process of out-sourcing catering, which will continue at least until the year 2000. If you take Europe and the U.S. together, the market is worth about 100 billion pounds, of which only 30 billion is outsourced." "That leaves two-thirds of the market still available, and we are in a very strong position to take advantage of that."
