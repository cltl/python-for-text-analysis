Toronto stocks ended weaker in brisk turnover on Tuesday, pulled down by weakness on Wall Street and a tumbling financial sector.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index lost 25.26 points to 6129.28. Trading was active as 106.6 million shares worth C$1.8 billion ($1.3 billion) changed hands.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 58.92 points to 6896.56 and Canada's banking group dropped almost one percent.
Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels said Toronto's market had traded in a narrow range recently as investors debated a possible hike in U.S. interest rates.
Once rates go up, bond yields increase and bond prices drop, attracting investors who then sell interest-sensitive issues such as banks. The bearish players believe rates will rise, while others think Canada's key index will sustain only a temporary setback before resuming its upward march.
"I feel there has been a constant fight recently between the bulls and the bears," Meisels said. He forecast Toronto would soon reverse its downward trend as investors hunted for bargains.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, nine fell, led by consumer products, base metals, banks and transports. Gaining groups included conglomerates, oils and golds.
Declining stocks outnumbered advances 561 to 397, while 299 traded unchanged.
Among individual stocks, Wascana Energy Inc. topped Toronto actives after Tuesday's news that Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd. said it planned a C$20.50 ($14.97) a share all-cash bid for Wascana. Wascana jumped 1.10 to 20.45 on 15.8 million shares and Canadian Occidental rose 1.70 to 25.15.
Wascana was seeking a white knight after a hostile bid from Talisman Energy Inc. Talisman shares traded flat at 43.60.
Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's largest, slipped 1.05 to 57.10 in light dealings.
