Australian resources and steel group The Broken Hill Pty Co (BHP) disappointed the share market on Friday with a weaker than expected second-quarter profit to post first-half net earnings of A$683 million before abnormals.
BHP, whose shares have been hammered since its key markets in steel and copper turned sour six months ago, booked an abnormal gain of A$107 million to boost the bottom line for the six months to November 30, but investors were not impressed.
