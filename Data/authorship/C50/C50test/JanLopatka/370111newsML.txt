A plan on how the Czech Republic will diversify natural gas supplies, now coming solely from Russia, has been delayed for several weeks, the Industry and Trade Ministry said on Tuesday.
"We are gathering information, analysing it, and it's going to take several weeks (before the issue is put before the government)," ministry spokesman Miroslav Konvalina said.
A plan had been expected to be submitted to the government sometime in January. Konvalina gave no reason for the delay.
Officials have declined to say which partners the government was considering, though government representatives have held talks on limited deliveries from Norway.
The ministry is drawing up plans for four options for securing gas supplies, but has given no details. No matter which plan is accepted, Russia is expected to remain the dominant supplier.
It said the four options being considered are:
- Purchasing all natural gas from Gazprom, using two different shipping routes, with a long-term agreement until 2016, with price guarantees until 1998.
- Purchasing some Russian gas indirectly through Dutch company Nederlandse Gasunie NV, and Germany's Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF AG. Gasunie would start supplies in 1998, delivering up to two billion cubic metres in 2005, with the agreement lasting until 2014.
In case of a fall in Russian supplies, it would deliver its own gas through Wingas, a joint venture of Wintershall (65 percent) and Gazprom (35 percent).
Wintershall offers a similar scheme, with deliveries starting on January 1 next year, rising to one billion cubic metres in 2000, under a deal until 2016. Negotiations with these firms are in the stage of initiating a supply contract.
- Finalising and maintaining the agreement for Norwegian gas, which was given preliminary approval this year, until 2017.
- A limited purchase from Mobil Europe Gas Inc, Germany's Brigitta Erdgas und Erdoel (BEB) and British Gas Plc .
The Czechs have ended their dependance on Russian crude oil by building a new pipeline to Germany, but are still completely dependant on supplies provided by Russia's Gazprom.
The Czech Republic consumes around eight to nine billion cubic metres of natural gas per year, but volumes are expected to rise to some 12-13 billion cubic metres by the turn of the century.
