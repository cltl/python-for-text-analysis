Lloyd's of London on Wednesday said that preliminary underwriting profits had topped the one billion pound mark for the second year running despite a slight drop from the previous year's level.
The insurance market made profits of 1.005 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) before tax and after members' personal expenses for the 1994 underwriting year. That was down from 1993's profits of 1.084 billion pounds but were in line with forecasts made by the market at the time of last year's figures.
Lloyd's reports results three years in arrears. The presence of corporate members in the 1994 numbers for the first time prompted a slightly earlier release of the figures than usual.
Corporate funds have been increasingly replacing Names -- individuals whose asets have traditionally supported the market -- since 1994 and account for around 44 percent of the capital underpinning business written this year.
Lloyd's returned to profit last year after five years of record losses totalling more than eight billion pounds which had threatened the very survival of the world's oldest insurance market.
Failure of the market was avoided with the successful completion of Lloyd's reconstruction plan last year.
The fall in profitability from one year to the next is a reflection of the cyclical nature of the insurance industry.
Years of high returns are often followed by more competitive pricing until an upturn in claims reverses the trend.
The preliminary 1994 result is based on an initial review of syndicate returns representing 94 per cent of the market's 1994 capacity of 10.898 billion pounds, and projections for the remaining syndicates.
Final figures for the 1994 year will be published in Lloyd's Global Results in early June when projected results for the 1995 and 1996 years of account will also be published.
Lloyd's Global Results 1995 projected a profit for the 1994 underwriting year of 1.008 billion pounds, using a sterling exchange rate of $1.55. The preliminary result of 1.005 billion is based on the exchange rate at 31 December 1996 of $1.71. ($ = 0.606 British Pounds)
