Apple Computer Inc is expected to report on Wednesday that it had a loss in its fiscal fourth quarter ended in September amid declining sales of its Macintosh computers, but a turnaround may be at hand.
Apple's management is likely to tell investors that the beleagured company is getting closer to resuming profitability, possibly as early as the December quarter, analysts said.  
"The financial condition of the company has been strengthened," said Todd Bakar, an analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco.  "Questions of their long-term viability don't come up as often anymore."
In the past three quarters, Apple has reported huge losses as customers have defected to cheap IBM-compatible personal computers running Microsoft Corp's easy-to-use Windows 95 software.  By cutting costs and firing workers, Apple has managed to whittle its losses.  
Wall Street expects Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., to post a loss of $0.30 a share, according to a recent survey of 23 analysts by First Call.  In the fiscal fourth quarter last year, Apple reported net income of $60.1 million, or $0.48 a share, on revenue of $3.0 billion.
Apple's new management, under former National Semiconductor Corp chief Gilbert Amelio, has done a good job cutting expenses, analysts said.
Apple also has managed to raise enough cash to be out of a dire cash shortage, which threatened to hamper day-to-day operations. The company could even generate a little cash from its business this quarter, analysts said.
The trick now is to convince consumers that the Macintosh is a worthy competitor to PC clones.
