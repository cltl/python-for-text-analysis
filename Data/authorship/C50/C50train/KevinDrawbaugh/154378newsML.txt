ClinTrials Research Inc expects to continue to expand revenues 35 to 45 percent per year, thanks to growing use by major pharmaceutical companies of outside research help and market share gains by the firm -- the world's fifth-largest contract research concern.
"We can grow at the 35-45 percent rate over the next several years and be able to handle it," said chief executive William O'Neil on Tuesday in remarks to investors at a Robinson-Humphrey investors conference here.
Later, in an interview with Reuters, O'Neil said the Nashville, Tenn.-based company estimates that drug and biotechnology companies spend $10 to $11 billion annually on research and development.
About $2.5 billion, or roughly one quarter, is outsourced to companies such as ClinTrials and rivals, including the Corning Research unit of Corning Inc and Quintiles Transnational Corp. "Five years ago, only five percent was outsourced. So it's been growing very rapidly," O'Neil said.
Moreover, he said, R&amp;D spending is growing about 10 percent annually and ClinTrials is taking market share from smaller contract researchers. "Of the additional dollars being spent, more is being shifted to us," he said.
ClinTrials recently acquired BioResearch Laboratories Inc, of Montreal, for $65 million. The acquisition was immediately accretive to earnings and effectively reduced ClinTrials' tax rate thanks to Canadian laws under which BioResearch pays no taxes, O'Neil said.
Without another major acquisition, ClinTrials likely will stay for now in the fifth-largest position in the contract research market, he said. Although he would not rule out another major deal, O'Neil said one is not in the offing.
Eighty percent of revenues for the company come from major drug companies, with biotech firms and medical device manufacturers making up the balance.
When such companies develop a new compound or device they hope may be marketable, they must test it through an extensive series of clinical trials. Animal subjects are first used. Later human patients become involved. All tests have to be conducted under standards set out by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other government regulators.
When launched in 1990, ClinTrials handled portions of research work that had overflowed the capacities of drug and biotech firms. Today, O'Neil said, ClinTrials finds itself increasingly built into the R&amp;D budgets of clients.
Last week, ClinTrials for the third quarter reported profits of $2 million, or $0.18 per share, on revenues of $25.4 million. In the year-ago period, profits were $979,000, or $0.11 per share, on revenues of $16 million.
Shares in the company closed up 1/2 at 38 on Tuesday.
