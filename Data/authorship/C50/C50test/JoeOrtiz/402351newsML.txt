National Westminster Bank Plc will perform further share repurchases if it generates more surplus capital, its chief executive Derek Wanless said on Tuesday.
Some analysts had expected NatWest to use it remaining shareholder authority to buy back 28 million shares which would have cost it some 220 million stg but the bank made no announcement when it posted its 1996 results earlier.
"If we've got surplus capital we will return it to shareholders," Wanless told Reuters in an interview. "That's still the policy and will remain the policy."  
Wanless said NatWest would ask shareholders to return its buy-back mandate to 100 million shares at its AGM in April but declined to give any clues on when a repurchase might actually be performed.
Wanless noted that NatWest's tier one capital ratio stood at 6.7 percent at the end of 1996, "which is in the range we talk about for tier one -- 6.5 to 6.7 -- obviously we are generating capital which isn't being used in the balance sheet."
He also pointed out that NatWest generated and used a large amount of capital -- on improving systems and technology in NatWest UK and on acquisitions to add to NatWest Markets, its investment banking arm -- in 1996.
Wanless said NatWest UK saw a six percent rise in income and a two percent fall in costs despite the fact that it was spending large amounts on new systems.
He said an additional 100 million pounds would be spent on this in 1997.
Earlier, NatWest posted a pre-tax profit of 1.12 billion stg, down from 1.75 billion in 1995, but this included 719 million stg disposal loss, 186 million stg charged for the restructuring of its retail bank and a 224 million stg gain from the sale of shares in venture capital firm 3i.
On the operating level, profits were up 27 percent at 1.61 billion stg.
Wanless noted that NatWest UK saw a six percent rise in income while costs were down two percent and said that the investment banking arm, NatWest Markets performed well.
NatWest Markets raised it pre-tax profit to 462 million stg from 304 million stg but Wanless admitted that much of this was down to a sharp fall in bad debt provisions which in 1995 were dominated by a large specific hit, generally understood to be have been against Eurotunnel debt.
In a statement with the figures, NatWest said it expected the pace of UK economic growth to slow in 1998 and as a consequence was adopting a more cautious approach to lending.
"Although the UK economic environment remains positive, we see the pace of growth slowing in 1998 and are adopting a more cautious approach to lending," said NatWest chairman Lord Alexander.
Wanless said NatWest expected UK base rates to rise to 7-1/4 percent by the end of the year compared to their current six percent level.
"We don't want people to get carried away by 3.5 percent (economic )growth this year which is what me might still see," Wanless said. "Our belief is that whoever wins the election, rates will rise and the fiscal position could well be tighter."
He added that NatWest was putting the lending policies in place now for people who will be paying back in that economic climate.
NatWest increased its general provisions against bad debts by 50 million stg and made specific provisions of 499 million stg.
The latter included a sharp rise at Lombard which Wanless said was a largely a function of its increasing consumer finance business.
