The Halifax Building Society, which will float for around 12 billion stg on the stock exchange this June, has headroom for increasing its mortgage market share by acquisition, its chief executive Mike Blackburn said on Tuesday.
"We do have some headroom before we would excite the attention of the OFT (competition watchdog -- The Office of Fair Trading)," Blackburn said in an interview. "We have said to ourselves that we could certainly go to 25 percent (mortgage market share) before any anti-competitive issues arise."
But Blackburn said the Halifax was not engaged in any acquisition discussions at the moment.
