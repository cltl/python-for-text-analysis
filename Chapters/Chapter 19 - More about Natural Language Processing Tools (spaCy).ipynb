    "# Chapter 19 - More about Natural Language Processing Tools (spaCy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data is unstructured. But if you want to extract information from text, then you often need to process that data into a more structured representation. The common idea for all Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools is that they try to structure or transform text in some meaningful way. You have already learned about four basic NLP steps: sentence splitting, ōtokenization, POS-tagging and lemmatization. For all of these, we have used the NLTK library, which is widely used in the field of NLP. However, there are some competitors out there that are worthwhile to have a look at. One of them is spaCy, which is fast and accurate and supports multiple languages. \n",

    "## 1. The NLP pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many tools and libraries designed to solve NLP problems. In Chapter 15, we have already seen the NLTK library for tokenization, sentence splitting, part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization. However, there are many more NLP tasks and off-the-shelf tools to perform them. These tasks often depend on each other and are therefore put into a sequence; such a sequence of NLP tasks is called an NLP pipeline. Some of the most common NLP tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenization:** splitting texts into individual words\n",
    "* **Sentence splitting:** splitting texts into sentences\n",
    "* **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging:** identifying the parts of speech of words in context (verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.)\n",
    "* **Morphological analysis:** separating words into morphemes and identifying their classes (e.g. tense/aspect of verbs)\n",
    "* **Stemming:** identifying the stems of words in context by removing inflectional/derivational affixes, such as 'troubl' for 'trouble/troubling/troubled'\n",
    "* **Lemmatization:** identifying the lemmas (dictionary forms) of words in context, such as 'go' for 'go/goes/going/went'\n",
    "* **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):** assigning the correct meaning to words in context\n",
    "* **Stop words recognition:** identifying commonly used words (such as 'the', 'a(n)', 'in', etc.) in text, possibly to ignore them in other tasks\n",
    "* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** identifying people, locations, organizations, etc. in text\n",
    "* **Constituency/dependency parsing:** analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence\n",
    "* **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL):** analyzing the semantic structure of a sentence (*who* does *what* to *whom*, *where* and *when*)\n",
    "* **Sentiment Analysis:** determining whether a text is mostly positive or negative\n",
    "* **Word Vectors (or Word Embeddings) and Semantic Similarity:** representating the meaning of words as rows of real valued numbers where each point captures a dimension of the word's meaning and where semantically similar words have similar vectors (very popular these days)\n",

    "* [Treetagger](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/) is a POS-tagger\n",

    "  that is able to process English, German, Spanish, French, Chinese and Arabic. (Each to\n",

    "\n",
    "* [The Maltparser](http://www.maltparser.org/) has models for English, Swedish, French, and Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, there are many **NLP-tools that have been developed for Python**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK)](http://www.nltk.org/): Incredibly versatile library with a bit of everything.\n",
    "  The only downside is that it's not the fastest library out there, and it lags behind the\n",
    "  state-of-the-art.\n",
    "    * Access to several corpora.\n",
    "    * Create a POS-tagger. (Some of these are actually state-of-the-art if you have enough training data.)\n",
    "    * Perform corpus analyses.\n",
    "    * Interface with [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/).\n",
    "* [Pattern](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern): A module that describes itself as a 'web mining module'. Implements a\n",
    "    tokenizer, tagger, parser, and sentiment analyzer for multiple different languages.\n",

    "Data is often messy, noisy or includes irrelevant information. Therefore, chances are big that you will need to do some cleaning before you can start with your analysis. This is especially true for social media texts, such as tweets, chats, and emails. Typically, these texts are informal and notoriously noisy. Normalising them to be able to process them with NLP tools is a NLP challenge in itself and fully discussing it goes beyond the scope of this course. However, you may find the following modules useful in your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [tweet-preprocessor](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tweet-preprocessor/0.4.0): This library makes it easy to clean, parse or tokenize the tweets. It supports cleaning, tokenizing and parsing of URLs, hashtags, reserved words, mentions, emojis and smileys.\n",
    "- [emot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/emot/1.0): Emot is a python library to extract the emojis and emoticons from a text (string). All the emojis and emoticons are taken from a reliable source, i.e. Wikipedia.org.\n",
    "- [autocorrect](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autocorrect/0.1.0): Spelling corrector (Python 3).\n",
    "- [html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#module-html): Can be used to remove HTML tags.\n",
    "- [chardet](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet): Universal encoding detector for Python 2 and 3.\n",
    "- [ftfy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ftfy): Fixes broken unicode strings.\n",
