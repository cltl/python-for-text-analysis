- Chip designer Mosaid Technologies Inc will see earnings bounce back in fiscal 1998 as the chip market re-ignites, Chief Executive George Cwynar said on Wednesday.
Cwynar told Reuters in an interview that he saw profit and revenue growth accelerating to the 20 percent range in fiscal 1998 from about two percent in fiscal 1997 ending April 30.
"This calendar year we're in, is going to be a slow recovery year," he said.
Mosaid last week reported that earnings per share for the third quarter ended January 31 fell to C$0.06 from year earlier C$0.32 due to the collapse in memory chip prices in the past year and delayed orders for chip testing systems.     Cwynar
said he expected the memory chip market to come back in 1998 as personal computer users snapped up the backlog of cheap chips and increased demand for Mosaid's bigger, faster designs.
Analysts predicted that Mosaid, based in Carp, a town about 35 km (21.75 miles) west of Ottawa, would recover from its recent slump, aided by ACCELERIX, a single component that would combine the functions of memory and logic.
Mosaid spokeswoman Sue Rutherford said that up to five analysts planned to start coverage of Mosaid, which posted revenues of C$37 million in fiscal 1996.
One analyst who declined to be identified said: "All the ingredients are there for a big comeback."
Mosaid increased its work in memory/logic design after acquiring a large stake in ACCELERIX Inc in October 1996. Cywnar said the ACCELERIX design could increase speed and cut space demands, making it ideal for portable products that are rapidly capturing buyers' interest.
"We expect to have the design finished this spring sometime," said Cwynar, adding that Mosaid anticipated "a production-ready design by the end of this calendar year."
Mosaid shares were down 0.35 to 14.25 in late trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
