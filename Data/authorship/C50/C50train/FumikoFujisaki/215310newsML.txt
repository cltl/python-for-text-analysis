Half-year results from Japan's 20 biggest banks show they have moved back into the black despite hefty write-offs of problem loans.
Analysts said figures released by 10 trust and credit banks Monday showed that all of Japan's big banks had continued actively writing off problem loans resulting from the collapse of Japan's 1980s "bubble" economy of over-priced real estate.
The 10 biggest commercial banks announced their interim earnings and loan write-off statistics Friday.
Combined write-offs by the 20 biggest banks totalled about 2.4 trillion yen ($21.4 billion) in the six months ended Sept. 30. Last fiscal year, the 20 big banks disposed of nearly 11 trillion yen ($98.2 billion) worth of problem loans.
At the end of March, the Finance Ministry said the 20 banks had about 25 trillion yen ($223 billion) worth of problem loans, which include loans made to bankrupt companies and those on which interest payments are in arrears by six months or more.
Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre, said the 20 banks may dispose of at least five trillion yen ($44.6 billion) worth of problem loans in the current fiscal year in order to cut the size of problem loans to manageable levels.
Analysts said many big banks were now recovering from the difficulties caused by the problem loans, but some financially-weak banks would continue to struggle to dispose of such loans in the coming years.
Yoshinobu Yamada, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan, said that major banks should be able to cut their problem loans to manageable levels this financial year, but added that "some banks are still reeling from the bad loan problem."
Three long-term credit banks -- Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank -- all recorded parent current profits for the first half after posting losses in 1995-1996.
Current profit is pre-tax and includes gains or losses from sales of securities.
The three said they disposed of 255.1 billion yen ($2.27 billion) of problem loans in the first half against a total of 1.93 trillion yen ($17.2 billion) last year.
Japan's seven major trust banks, all of which posted parent current losses in 1995-1996, said they posted combined parent current profits of 316.76 billion yen ($2.82 billion) in the first half after disposing of 1.02 trillion yen ($9.1 billion) of problem loans in the period.
This compared with disposals of 2.69 trillion yen ($24.0 billion) last year.
