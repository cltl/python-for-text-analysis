Asiana Airlines is to take delivery of a third new Boeing 747-400 freighter next month to replace a wet leased DC-10 cargo aircraft on the Seoul to New York route, the airline's cargo marketing and sales director, T.S. Kang said.
The South Korean carrier uses two DC-10 freighters wet leased from U.S. operators Gemini Air Cargo and World Airways for its six flights per week to New York.
The World Airways freighter is to be returned and Gemini's retained until the end of next year to continue to fly three times a week to New York with the new Boeing flying the other three, Kang told Reuters in a telephone interview from Seoul.
The 747-400 will offer Asiana extra cargo carrying capacity as it carries more than 100 tonnes compared to around 65 tonnes for the DC-10.
"The new 747 which is about to be delivered will replace one of the DC-10s which is being returned. One 747 equals two DC-10 flights and is a welcome addition to our fleet," Kang said
Asiana has two 747-400 and one 767 freighter and has  plans to expand its cargo aircraft fleet to 10 by 2005.
Kang said Gemini has now received permission from Korea's Ministry of Transportation and Construction to fly into Korea under its own name. Gemini specialises in offering its converted aircraft to established airlines on wet lease contracts known as ACMI - aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance.
