Advanced Technology Laboratories Inc's chairman and chief executive expects 1997 revenues to rise six to seven percent from the $329.7 million generated last year.
Dennis Fill also said in an interview on Thursday that he was "comfortable" with analyst estimates that the ultrasound equipment maker would earn $1.75 to $1.90 a share this year. In 1996, it earned $1.46, excluding non-recurring items.
Gross profit margin should rise to about 51 percent of revenues from 48.9 percent in 1996, he said.
"That gives customers great flexibility, lower costs and brings a great improvement in capability to the midrange market," Fill said from Orlando, where he was attending a medical conference.
The new HDI 1000 also includes a WebLink component that allows users to send images directly over the Internet without the need to pass through a computer workstation.
Fill said the new system, for general ultrasound applications excluding cardiovascular, would sell for $50,000 to $100,000 depending on features, compared with $135,000 to $250,000 for the company's high-end HDI 3000.
