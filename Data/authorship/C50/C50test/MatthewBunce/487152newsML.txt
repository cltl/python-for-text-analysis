Port arrivals of 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) Ivorian coffee totalled about 175,000 tonnes by March 24 compared to about 160,000 tonnes in 1995/96 but more remains upcountry, exporters said.
"My figures show 175,000 tonnes by March 24 (since mid-November)," said one port source. "Arrivals dropped off over the past week but there is still plenty upcountry. We have had perhaps three-quarters of the crop."
Another exporter put arrivals at closer to 200,000 tonnes by April although the rate of deliveries had slowed.
Exporters and crop analysts expect the 1996/97 crop to at least equal Ivory Coast's official forecast of 230,000 tonnes, against 180,000 tonnes produced in 1995/96 when coffee arrivals tailed off sharply in late March.
Port sources said exports by April reached 50,000 tonnes, similar to the same period in the 1995/96 year in which 150,000 tonnes were exported.
Buying had been dominated by coffee exporters JAG, SIFCA and SHAC with local processor Nestle expected by industry to roast 30,000 tonnes at its Abidjan processing unit.
"There's a lot of coffee coming in but as exports are still slow stocks are building," said one forwarder.
Coffee marketing and exports got off to a later start this year after the season was opened about six weeks late. Banks refused to finance early buying operations because of low world prices before a rally in early 1997.
Coffee quality has since been dogged by black beans resulting from farmers harvesting unripe green cherries in a rush to sell.
Farmers and unions said derisory farmgate prices were being paid by buyers, in some areas 300 CFA per kilo below the official 495 CFA guideline miniumum price.
"Price adjustments mean two tonnes are cut out for every 30 tonnes delivered," said one SYNAGCI farm union leader. "Fifty percent of the crop was sold by farmers for between 200 and 250 CFA a kilo," he added.
"Most have been paid between 300 to 450 CFA," said an industry buyer.
One port quality inspector said no more than 150,000 tonnes of coffee might be exported in 1996/97 but exporters dismissed the prediction.
Prices paid for coffee on Ivory Coast's export contract allocation auction system were largely in line with European market rates, they said, and problems of overbidding for cocoa contracts had not been repeated in the coffee sector, exporters said.
Export markets were being found although Ivory Coast has said it would no longer market black beans, industry sources said.
The Caistab marketing board recently condidered issuing a second marketing price structure to cover large volumes of low grade 1996/97 beans but had shelved the idea.
"What I hear from people in the Caistab is nothing will be done (on prices) for now but maybe they will have to consider it," said one large buyer. "The market is very changeable. One day you can sell anything, the next it is all sitting in the warehouse."
Ivory Coast agreed in February to limit January to June exports by around 15,000 tonnes after an Association of Coffee Producing Countries meeting in December aimed at pushing up world prices.
"It would all be shipped in June anyway, if anything is done at all," said one exporter. "People can just go and buy from Vietnam and others not in the (ACPC) agreement."
