Coupon clipping is coming to cyberspace.
SaveSmart Inc., a start-up company based in Mountain View, Calif., plans to unveil on Monday a credit card-based scheme to allow computer users to browse for and take advantage of bargains offered by a wide range of local, regional and national merchants.
Consumers will be able to qualify for automated discounts on groceries, dining out, movies, clothing, furniture and auto repairs, among other items.
The company said that using its special credit card eliminates the inconvenience and inefficency of paper-based promotional coupons delivered in newspapers or by direct mail. Industry figures show that only about 2 percent of paper coupons are actually redeemed.
SaveSmart said the service dramatically enhances sales promotions by making it easier for consumers to find and use them, while making them cost-effective for merchants to offer.
"We are driving physical traffic into the merchants' stores," said Bernard David, SaveSmart's executive vice president of business development.
Advertising analysts said the new interactive promotion service could play a key role in transforming the industry, which generates about $120 billion a year, according to the media research firm of Veronis, Suhler and Associates.
"All Web promotions need to be attractive in the real world, not just the virtual world of cyberspace," said Mary Doyle, a Web marketing analyst for IDC/Link Resources.
What differentiates SaveSmart from thousands of other Internet-based commerce efforts is the linkage the service makes between computer users and actual businesses, she said.
The company's Web site -- www.savesmart.com -- offers an online database of merchant promotions personalized to fit the individual's interests.
Consumers can browse through promotional offerings and when they find a promotion they want, "select" it and reserve it. They can then redeem the promotion by presenting the SaveSmart card at a merchant's store at the time of purchase.
SaveSmart targets what it describes as "neighborhood trading areas" of roughly 100,000 people.
The service will be launched Monday in the area around Palo Alto, Calif., with service expanding to include the entire San Francisco Bay Area by the end of the year.
In 1997, the company plans to roll the system out in 10 additional U.S. cities where Internet use is most heavily concentrated, including Boston, New York, Washington D.C./Baltimore and Orange County, just south of Los Angeles.
The company said it plans a coordinated direct marketing campaign in each city where the service is introduced to sign up individual card members using mail and newspaper ads.
In addition, SaveSmart said it has been successful in promoting the card as an employee benefit offered by large computer companies.
"Our target is to have tens of thousands of SaveSmart members within each neighbourhood trading area," David said, adding that he expected to meet that goal in SaveSmart's first service areas "within a couple of months, to be quite frank."
To date, SaveSmart said it has signed up 400 merchants, representing a cross-section of locally available goods and services. McDonald's, Domino's Pizza and Subway Sandwiches are participating. In addition, it has agreed to a deal with at least one major movie studio, which it declined to name.
While the system would appear to be a threat to traditional promotional outlets like direct mail marketers and newspaper publishers, SaveSmart said it is working with one leading U.S. household direct marketer and that there is nothing to preclude it from linking up with news publishers.
David said SaveSmart would also make a logical fit with local telephone companies, but declined to say whether the company had reached any such agreements.
The company, which has about 30 employees,. was founded by executives from VeriFone Inc. and other Silicon Valley computer firms. VeriFone is a leading global supplier of merchant credit card transaction terminals.
SaveSmart provides special VeriFone-built terminals to merchants using its credit-card system.
Company officials said SaveSmart is designed to leave open the possibility that the system could be adopted by a major credit card company, so that consumers could use their normal credit card to conduct SaveSmart transactions.
The company has held talks with major credit card companies, but there are no deals to announce, officials said.
SaveSmart has not disclosed its financial backers. Industry consultants familiar with the company said they include Bill Melton, founder of VeriFone, and also CyberCash Inc., an Internet commerce company.
Other backers include members of Germany's Quandt family, who are ranked among the world's richest families, they said.
