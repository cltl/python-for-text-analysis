With its clump of bubble-shaped rooms, the home seemed to spring out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. \n\nGrey quickly realized, \u201cI just don\u2019t have another house that\u2019s like this. \n\n\u201d \n\nThat didn\u2019t make the property a white elephant, though. \n\nWhen Grey asked several real estate agents in the Bay Area whether there was a market for the unusual home, he recalled, \u201cThe consensus was there\u2019s constant demand. \n\n\u201d \n\nSure enough, a buyer snapped it up for $800,000. \n\nNearly two decades later, the quirky marvel \u2013 remodeled and enhanced \u2013 is on the market again, this time for $4.2 million. \n\nIt\u2019s one of several out-of-the-ordinary dwellings that have been making headlines lately. \n\nIn the Mojave Desert, a house shaped like a spaceship and set on the 150-foot cinder cone of an extinct volcano was listed at $650,000 earlier this month and went into escrow Friday. The property, on 60 acres with a lake, got multiple offers. In Beverly Hills, a sprawling compound touted as the priciest home in the U.S. last year just took a $46 million price cut. \n\nDespite their differences, houses like these raise a common question: How does anyone \u2013 real estate professionals, sellers or buyers \u2013 figure out what off-the-wall, over-the-top homes are worth? \n\nThe Volcano House was owned by TV personality Huell Howser, who gave it to Chapman University in 2012, a year before his death. The university had originally planned to use the house for desert studies, astronomy and geology pursuits. But it\u2019s selling the property because its desert location, in Newberry Springs east of Barstow, was deemed too isolated for students. \n\nBrady Sandahl of Hom Sotheby\u2019s International Realty says he and another agent listing the house considered other \u201carchitecturally significant\u201d properties, mostly in the high desert, in coming up with the $650,000 price tag. \n\n\u201cYou just develop a business gut as to what you think the market will capture,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you turn to the buyers, and they\u2019ll tell you why they\u2019re giving you what they\u2019re giving you. That\u2019s the beauty of an open market. \n\n\u201d \n\nSandahl said the multiple offers he received show the asking price was appropriate; three offers came in at $650,000 or more. \n\nBut clearly, the price tag would be higher if the property wasn\u2019t so remote. \n\n\u201cThis is real estate,\u201d said Grey, who appraised the Flintstone House. \u201cThe first three rules of real estate are location, location, location. \n\n\u201d \n\nThe Flintstone House is on the opposite side of that rule. It\u2019s 17 miles from San Francisco and right near I-280, a major freeway. \n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the yard of the Flintstone House,\u201d Grey said, \u201cyou hear that freeway very clearly. \n\n\u201d \n\nWhile the noise outside the home is a minus, on the plus side, Grey said, the house itself is nearly soundproof: \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a cave. \n\n\u201d \n\nHe attributes that to the construction. Steel rebar and wire mesh frames were built over large inflated weather balloons then covered with gunite, or \u201cshotcrete.\u201d He said that makes the walls thicker than a typical home\u2019s. \n\nAppraising even unusual homes involves the basics, Grey said. Size, number of rooms, quality of finishes and condition are all factors considered in addition to location. \n\n\u201cThose are relevant to any house, no matter how unusual or historical or plain it is,\u201d he said. \n\nTHE COMPS \n\nWith no truly comparable homes, Grey said, he used a bracketing system to determine where the Flintstone House fit on a spectrum. He placed the area\u2019s high-end Tudor homes and plain ranch homes at opposite ends. \n\n\u201cAppraising something \u2026 it\u2019s quite a bit more art than science,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of appraising that house, I put it right in the middle. \n\n\u201d \n\nHe did not make comparisons with unusual homes elsewhere in the country, he said. \n\nWith land value varying greatly, he explained, \u201cYou could be avoiding an adjustment regarding the design of the house and making a huge adjustment for the difference in location. \n\n\u201d \n\nIn Southern California, Realtors Joyce Rey and Stacy Gottula of Coldwell Banker Previews International cast a considerably wider net to come up with Palazzo di Amore\u2019s $195 million price tag, which has since dropped to $149 million. \n\nThe agents said they looked to the most expensive homes worldwide. \n\nThe 25-acre compound with its own vineyard in Beverly Hills was touted as the most expensive in the U.S. when it came on the market last year. \n\nThe gated, 12-bedroom, 23-bathroom property was eight years in the making. It\u2019s reached by a quarter-mile, tree-lined drive and has a guard station. A two-level entertainment center, with a 50-seat screening room and a bowling alley, is entered through a floating glass-floor walkway over pools lined by 70-year-old olive trees. \n\nThe main residence tops 35,000 square feet, while the entire estate has more than 53,000 square feet of living space. There\u2019s garage parking for 27 cars, though the site \u201ccan easily accommodate parking for (approximately) 150 cars,\u201d according to the listing. \n\n\u201cThere are so few comps, you really have to look at the history of sales in the area as well as the global sales,\u201d Gottula said. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be a global citizen of some kind,\u201d Rey said of the likely buyers. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have houses in various places, and they\u2019re going to be looking, in all probability, in all of those markets. \n\n\u201d \n\nThe Realtors considered the highest sales in London, Hong Kong, France and elsewhere.
