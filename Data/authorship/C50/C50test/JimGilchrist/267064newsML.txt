KLM Cargo intends to increase air cargo rates in northern Asia by between five and 10 per cent in the first quarter of the new year, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV regional director sales, Tom Presnail told Reuters.
"Exactly by how much has not been decided yet but it is definitely our objective to raise our income if at all possible sometime during the first quarter. A decision will be made by the end of January and rates raised sometime after that," he said in an interview from his Tokyo office.
"My personal preference would be for a blanket rise (on all routes) but it might vary in some markets," he added.
Presnail said he is responsible for KLM Cargo flights to the Japanese capital and Osaka as well as Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul and Beijing.
The KLM executive said the main reason for a planned rate rise in his area continues to be "dramatic" increases in fuel costs coupled with continuing general cost increases while yields continue to give cause for concern.
"Yields have come back fairly strongly in the last quarter but they are still, if anything, where they were a year and a half ago. Fuel is one thing but other costs have escalated too and there is definitely the need for more upward movement in prices," he added.
Presnail added that current demand for cargo space aboard KLM's Asian freighters is strong.
"Most of Asia has been enjoying a very good, strong peak season with a lot of depth which is hanging on, hopefully into the new year too. It is refreshing. All indications are that it is the best peak season for a number of years," Presnail added.
