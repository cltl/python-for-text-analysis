Zinc producer Pasminco Ltd said on Wednesday it hoped to run to the Australian stock market soon with a major share issue to help fund the development of the roughly A$1 billion Century zinc project.
Pasminco has engaged brokerages J.B. Were and SBC Warburg as underwriters for the equity issue, said the company's executive general manager of finance, Bronwyn Constance.
"Within three months we could be announcing what we are doing and going to the market," she told Reuters.  
Pasminco is looking to the equity and debt markets to raise up to about A$1 billion to fund the development of the Century zinc deposit, one of the world's largest in northern Australia.
Pasminco has also approached banks, both domestic and international, to negotiate a syndicated loan, Constance said.
A lead group of banks will be announced in the next month or so, she added. She declined to name the banks being considered.
Pasminco, which has conditionally agreed to buy the Century project and associated deposits for A$345 million from global miner RTZ-CRA, has yet to decide the mix of equity and debt needed to fund the development, Constance said.
