French defence electronics company Thomson-CSF, soon to be sold by the state, Wednesday posted 1996 results that showed a return to profit after three years of heavy losses.
Thomson-CSF reported net profit of 745 million francs ($129 million) compared with a net loss of 791 million ($137 million) for 1995. Sales were up 2.2 percent at 36.27 billion ($6.3 billion).
The government, after a bungled first attempt, is trying to privatise Thomson-CSF as part of a defence industry restructuring that could have an impact on the entire European sector.
French engineering and telecommunications giant Alcatel Alsthom has teamed up with aircraft maker Dassault Aviation and state-owned Aerospatiale to bid for Thomson-CSF. Lagardere, involved in businesses ranging from missiles to publishing, is also bidding, supported by British Aerospace Plc.
Thomson-CSF said its operating profit rose 5.6 percent to 2.07 billion francs ($358 million) despite a reduction in military budgets and tougher markets. The improvement was due to better competitiveness following restructuring efforts pursued over a number of years.
The net result was dented by an exceptional charge of 824 million francs ($143 million), compared with 753 million ($130 million) in the prior year, to cover restructuring costs tied to the shrinking of markets and cost-cutting measures, it said.
Consolidated pretax profit was 1.30 billion francs ($225 million), versus a loss of 437 million ($76 million), which included a 101 million franc ($17.5 million) hit from its the sale of its holding in the troubled state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais.
Thomson-CSF's previous three years' losses were essentially due to falls in the value of Credit Lyonnais' shares, which were taken on Thomson-CSF's accounts to reflect its equity stake.
Europe, excluding France, contributed more than 10 billion francs ($1.7 billion) in sales for the first time, compared with less than four billion ($692 million) in 1995.
"The European market accounts for 28 percent of the consolidated turnover, against only 10 percent at the end of the 1980s," it said, adding this was due to its policy of external growth through acquisitions.
Its holding in profitable semiconductor maker SGS-Thomson contributed 588 million francs ($102 million), up from 477 million ($83 million) in 1995.
Net debt fell to 900 million ($156 million) from 2.3 billion ($398 million).
