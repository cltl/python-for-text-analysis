Cathay Pacific Airways Limited is the first airline to test fly a new 'sharks skin' aircraft coating which could reduce fuel costs and revolutionise air travel, a Cathay spokeswoman told Reuters.
One of Cathay's four Airbus A340-300 aircraft has been partly covered by transparent, plastic adhesive foils containing fine ridges or riblets which resemble the texture of sharks' skin.
The spokeswoman said scientists discovered that sharks swim faster because their skin is covered in fine ridges running lengthwise along their bodies which reduces drag.
She said Airbus Industrie hope the streamlining principle can be transferred to aircraft, reducing the amount of fuel burned by up to one percent.
Over an aircraft's lifetime, the fuel bill saving could be huge at a time when rising fuel prices are a highly topical subject.
Airbus said it has already been conducting trials for several years with the U.S. manufacturer 3M but Cathay is the first scheduled airline to apply the latest technology, higher durability film.
Cathay passengers flying on long haul routes to Rome, Zurich, Toronto and Melbourne will not notice unless they look very closely at the fuselage and the differing destinations will offer a testing environment for the coating, the spokeswoman added.
"It is a very interesting development for Cathay to be involved in and anything that helps to cut the cost of fuel will be extremely welcome to us and the whole industry," the spokeswoman said.
She said the experiment is expected to last between one and five years with Airbus and 3M engineers visiting the aircraft for regular checks. Cathay's Flight Planning and Performance Department engineers will also be monitoring its performance, she said.
"We will have been an industry leader if this is a success," she added.
