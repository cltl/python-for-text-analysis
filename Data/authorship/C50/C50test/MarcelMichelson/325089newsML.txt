Franco-Italian semiconductor group SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV on Wednesday reported a 19 percent rise in 1996 earnings to $625.5 million but warned about the first quarter of 1997 after a weak end to last year.
The profit warning and lower fourth quarter results took the market by surprise and the share closed nearly 12 percent lower at 379.40 francs in Paris in a turnover of 542 million francs ($98 million).
The French blue-chip index closed 1.35 percent higher.
"There is an awful lot of profit-taking. Now that it is falling 12 percent people are seeing a disaster, but it has been rising a lot in January," said a dealer.
SGS-Thomson has been steadily climbing from 154.50 francs in July to 433 francs on January 20, with the rise accelerated earlier this month when Intel Corp reported a big rise in quartely profits.
At SGS-Thomson, the fourth quarter earnings were down by 15.5 percent to $142 million.
President and chief executive Pasquale Pistorio said he was pleased with the 1996 performance. He was cautious about the first quarter of 1997 although he said the company would still outperform the industry average.
"With lead times shrinking throughout the industry, we are entering the first quarter of 1997 with less order visibility than we have historically enjoyed," he said.
"From what we know today, we expect 1997 first quarter revenues to be close to third quarter 1996 levels. We also anticipate that overall pricing pressures will continue, and therefore, in spite of productivity improvements, gross margins could be slightly below fourth quarter 1996 levels."
In the third quarter, net revenues were $988.4 million.
"While first quarter conditions continue to be uncertain, we believe that subsequent quarters of 1997 will show progressive improvement compared to the 1997 first quarter as the company continues to emphasise differentiated products and high growth applications," Pistorio added.
"Recent contracts with key customers and new design wins in such high growth areas as hard disk drives, set-top boxes and digital cellular phones give us confidence that SGS-Thomson will continue to outperform the industry average in 1997."
Company chief economist Jean-Phillipe Dauvin said the world semiconductor market had fallen by eight percent in 1996 which made it the third worst year on record for the industry.
The fall was to a large extent due to price pressures, with prices of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips plunging by 80 to 90 percent, causing losses at many chipmakers.
SGS-Thomson does not make DRAMs, however, but dedicated chips which shielded it somewhat from the price erosion. Its market rose by five percent.
Dauvin said that market research bureaux WSTS, Dataquest and VLSI Research were predicting a 1997 market increase ranging from respectively 7.4 percent to 14.9 percent.
"In 1997 there will probably be a slight recovery but we will not see a big upturn until 1998. It is possible that we have to postpone the start of the recovery from June-July to the second half of 1997," Dauvin added.
In 1996, according to Dataquest estimates, SGS-Thomson moved to the ninth place in the world ranking from 14 in 1995, being the sole chip maker with Intel to show significant sales growth.
Dauvin said he maintained his forecast that the chip market would be worth $300 billion in 2000, against $133 billion now. ($1=5.547 French Franc)
