Heavy April rains in Ivorian cocoa areas have favoured mid-crop (May-Sept) pod growth and flowering for early 1997/98 main crop (Oct-April) harvests, weather and crop analyts said on Thursday.
"At the end of March we were at 109 percent of the 10-year average (Jan-Mar) in all but a few areas," said one crop analyst. "I would say April has been about average but the last 10 days will give the overall picture."
National weather centre forecasters said coastal and inland areas, particularly around Yamoussoukro and Gagnoa, had received well above average levels in the first 20 days of April. "If rains are heavy for the last 10 days of April you can say the (long) rainy season has begun (usually lasting until August)."
Many crop analysts use private data from undisclosed areas but official weather data for the first 20 days of April showed rains at 10 weather stations averaged 78.85 mm. A total of 95 mm fell in the first 10 days of April and 693.5 in the second.
One crop analyst put overall 1997 rainfall at just below average. Another said rains had risen to 145 mm against his 10-year average figure of 134 mm for 12 stations. Rains in some areas had been between 35-145 percent above normal.
"March and April have been good and recent rains also seem quite heavy," said one. "April could be close to its average."
March rains averaged 111 mm, against crop analysts' long-term averages ranging from 80-90 mm. February rains of 10 mm (against a usual 50 mm average) had threatened mid crop potential until rain fell later, crop analysts said.
Young flowers for 1997/98 main crop harvests where more abundant than at the same time last year but accurate predictions of harvests would not be possible until June onwards, analysts said.
Crop analysts' estimates of the 1996/97 midcrop range between 150,000 tonnes and 200,000 tonnes but rains into May will partly determine harvests. Arrivals stood at 970-980,000 tonnes by mid April.
"Mid-crop assessments are particularly difficult. You need to visit four times as many sites for an accurate indication because of the smaller number of pods involved," one explained.
Mid-crop arrivals, with smaller bean sizes than last year's export grade harvests (up to 105 beans/100 grammes), are expected from early May -- against mid-April last year.
One set of official weather data show rainfall averages for the first three months of 1997 were 34.6, 11.3 and 100 mm respectively -- against 14.2, 50.2 and 64.9 in the record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 season.
The long-term averages for the same three months (1987-96) were 13.6, 37.4, 83.2. For April, the average was 130.4.
The latest April 1997 data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the first 10 days of April in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days bracketed):
Daloa 0.2 (105.8), Gagnoa 0 (142.8), San Pedro 0 (18.3), Tabou 0.4 (1.0) Man 5.4 (98.7), Dimbokro 18.3 (73.2), Yamoussoukro 22.1 (83.8), Abidjan 0 (128.8), Sassandra 0 (10.6), Adiake 33.7 (64.5), Korhogo 15.1 (14.2).
For the second 10 days of April, the rains were:
Daloa 49.3, Gagnoa 63.7, San Pedro 47.1, Tabou 57.0, Man 29.3, Dimbokro 22.2, Yamoussoukro 107.7, Abidjan 156.5, Sassandra 39.1, Adiake 69.9, Korogho 51.7.
