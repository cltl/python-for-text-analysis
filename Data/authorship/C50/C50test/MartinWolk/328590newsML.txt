Forestry giant Weyerhaeuser Co. Wednesday reported sharply lower fourth-quarter earnings, capping a year of mixed results dragged down by pulp and paper prices.
Several other timber industry companies also reported comparatively weak fourth-quarter results blamed on poor market conditions.
For the fourth quarter Weyerhaeuser posted earnings of $98 million or 50 cents a share, compared with $251 million or $1.25 a share a year earlier. Revenues in the quarter fell to $2.8 billion from $3.1 billion.
The earnings figure was above the Wall Street consensus of 48 cents a share mainly because of strong operating earnings in the company's real estate business, analysts said.
But Weyerhaeuser closed off $1 at $49.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
For the year Weyerhaeuser, based in Federal Way, Wash., reported net income of $463 million or $2.34 a share, down from $983 million or $4.83 a share before a special charge in 1995. Revenues for the year fell to $11.1 billion from $11.8 billion.
"1996 was a year of mixed results,"  said John Creighton, Weyerhaeuser president and chief executive officer, who cited lower pulp and paper prices but "solid demand" for wood products in the United States and Japan.
Pulp and paper operating earnings for the year fell to $307 million from a record $1.18 billion in 1995. Earnings from timberlands and wood products were virtually flat at $805 million, compared with $808 million.
Portland, Ore.-based Louisiana-Pacific Corp. reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $14.7 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of $567 million, compared with net income of $26.8 million or 25 cents a share on sales of $670.3 million a year earlier.
For the year the company reported a net loss of $201 million, or $1.87 a share, blamed mainly on a pre-tax charge of $350 million for the closing of its pulp mill in Ketchikan, Alaska.
In 1995 the company had a loss of $51.7 million or 48 cents a share including a pretax charge of $366.6 million mainly to account for the settlement of class-action lawsuits over the company's siding.
Louisiana-Pacific chairman and chief executive officer Mark Suwyn said the company had resolved key legal and organizational issues in 1996 but still faced an oversupply in the market for its key product of oriented strand board, used in building.
Louisiana-Pacific stock closed up 25 cents at $21.
Clayton, Mo.-based Jefferson Smurfit Corp. posted net income of $14 million, or 13 cents a share, for the fourth quarter, down from $64 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were $816 million, compared with $973 million.
For the full year the company earned $112 million, or $1.01 a share, compared with $243 million, or $2.19 a share. Sales fell to $3.4 billion from $4.1 billion in 1995.
Company president and chief executive officer Richard Graham said inventories in containerboard and newsprint have declined steadily over the past several months, promising some relief to the weak pricing environment.
"Given continued economic expansion, we could see a recovery in the company's principal markets during the second half of 1997," he said.
Jefferson Smurfit fell 43.75 cents to close at $15.06 on Nasdaq.
