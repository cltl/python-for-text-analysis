Wolseley Plc, the British building materials giant, is seen reporting slightly lower year pretax profits next Tuesday as expected, but reporting a rise in its dividend payout.
Wolseley was one of many in the sector to issue a profit warning earlier this year when it said that year profits for the period to July 31 would not match 1995.  
But the group is seen turning in a more solid performance for the year than rivals including Redland Plc and RMC Group Plc who have been hit by their heavy exposure to the German market.
Analysts forecasts for Wolseley's year profits ranged from 230 million stg to 240 million, with an average prediction of 234.9 million against 245.4 million last year.
The dividend is expected to come out between 10.3 pence and 10.5 pence, with analysts predicting an average payout of 10.3 pence against 9.8 pence last year.  
A key reason for its relatively better performance compared to sector rivals is that that 50 percent of Wolseley's revenues stemmed from the U.S. market, an analyst said.
"The U.S. may have its regional differences but nationally the economy is doing well," he said.
He added, however, that the UK market remained difficult and France continued to be "dreadful."
France is expected to continue to be difficult, while in the UK a recent uptick in the housing market may have fed through to materials firms -- but this remains to be seen.  
With a recent changeover of top management, market watchers will also be looking for evidence of any tinkering with the group strategy.
Wolseley's existing strategy is seen as sound and analysts may be perturbed if there is evidence of it being radically altered, said one.
No exceptionals are anticipated in the results.
