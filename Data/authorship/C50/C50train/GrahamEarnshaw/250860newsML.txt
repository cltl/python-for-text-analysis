Shanghai copper futures, which have fallen steadily over the past year, will see further declines in early 1997 with fundamentals poor and domestic demand stable, analysts and traders said on Wednesday.
Shanghai copper has fallen from its record high of around 32,000 yuan a tonne in mid-1995 to the 20,000-yuan level, although it is slightly up on its lowest levels of below 19,000 yuan touched in October.
"The downward trend in copper prices is world-wide with the supply of copper rising fast due to higher prices a couple of years ago, while demand is increasing more slowly in line with the world economy," a local metals analyst said.
The analyst, who works for a financial markets consulting firm, said the current price trend could conceivably continue for more than a year.
"From a long-term view, copper will not stop its downward trend until the middle of 1998 as there is usually a three- to five-year cycle of prices on the world market," the analyst said.
China's domestic demand for copper is also stable due to the government's continued tight monetary policy in place since 1993 to prevent the economy from over-heating, analysts said.
In the first nine months of 1996, China's consumption of copper was about 530,000 tonnes, about the same as the 1995 level, local traders said.
"In China, a shortfall of 250,000 tonnes of copper is expected in 1996," a local trader said. "But if you include imports, supplies are sufficient."
China imported 177,500 tonnes of copper in the first nine months of this year, up 60,900 tonnes from the same 1995 period, official figures show.
A local trader said Shanghai copper is likely to fall further to 19,000 yuan, possibly hitting a low of 17,000 yuan before the end of the year.
"In 1997, Shanghai copper will continue its steady downward movement, but it is possible for particularly sharp falls or rebounds in futures prices in certain periods of high speculation," he said.
"The recent rebound in prices both in London and Shanghai, triggered by falls in stockpiles on the London Metal Exchange, is a good example of such speculative movements," he said.
"Mature Chinese speculators will not miss any chances to make prices fluctuate for profits," he said.
