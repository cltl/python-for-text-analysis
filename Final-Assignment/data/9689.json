We have a great team at Bedel Financial that allows me to focus all of my attention on providing the highest level of service and customized financial guidance for my clients. I would not be able to achieve success and recognition without a great support team. I am very fortunate to work at a firm that allows me  to decide which clients best fit me, versus the other way around. This allows me to work with people I truly enjoy. All of my clients are people I want to establish a trusting relationship with for the next 30-\u00adplus years.  I want to thank my clients for sharing their experiences with friends and family, which has allowed me to grow my GenerationNeXt department, says Evan Bedel of Bedel Financial Consulting, Inc. \n \nThe 2015 Five Star Wealth Manager award winners have been carefully selected for their commitment to providing quality services to their clients. The award is based on an in-\u00addepth research process incorporating peer and firm feedback with objective criteria such as client retention rates, client assets administered, industry experience and regulatory and complaint history. \n \nBedel Financial Consulting, Inc. is a fee-only, commission-free wealth management firm, dedicated to helping clients achieve financial security. The firm was recently recognized by WealthManagement.com as one of the top 25 Women-Owned Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) in the country. I specifically provide financial guidance for young professionals and future wealth accumulators between the ages of 20 and 40. It is my passion to help these individuals and families establish a solid financial foundation for their future. In 2009, I created a department called GenerationNeXt to focus on these accumulators to help guide them toward an affluent path, Evan explains. \n \nEvan tells us about how he got into his profession: My mother, Elaine Bedel, established the firm over 25 years ago, so her influence and success in the industry were certainly key reasons why I became a financial planner. Another reason is that I enjoy connecting with people, establishing trusted relationships, problem solving and presenting creative ways to enhance the financial lives of others. \n \nEvan Bedels Five Star award profile can be viewed here . \n \nDisclosure: \n \nThe Five Star Wealth Manager award, administered by Crescendo Business Services, LLC (dba Five Star Professional), is based on 10 objective criteria: 1.
