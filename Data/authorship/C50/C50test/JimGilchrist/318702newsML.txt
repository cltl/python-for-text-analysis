British Airways World Cargo raised ex-Hong Kong market rates by HK$1.50 per kilo from January one to compensate for higher fuel prices, BA's area manager for Greater China, Chris Chan said.
BA was the only airline not to get involved in the controversy over a fuel surcharge late last year, he added. Then when freight forwarders' complained over fuel surcharges, most carriers operating European services raised ex-Hong Kong market rates on January 1 by HK$1 a kilo instead.
However, when asked in the second week of January if BA would also be raising rates in line with its competitors, a senior BA official in Hong Kong had said the airline would "wait and see."
Chan said BA's HK$1.50 market rate rise was imposed on January 1 and followed a 50 HK cents rise on November 1 because of rising fuel prices.
Customer resistance to any price rise was "inevitable" but customers were realising how hard fuel prices have hit airlines, he noted.
Chan said despite the increase, current demand was strong with BA's three times a week wet lease freighter service to London Gatwick operating at full capacity. -- Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
