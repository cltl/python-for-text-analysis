Toronto's key stock index set new highs on Wednesday, powered by glittering gold stocks as gold futures soared on precious metal markets.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index jumped 38.46 points to close at 6165.38, its seventh record close of 1997. The index also set an intraday high of 6172.13.
Trading was heavy with 119.6 million shares changing hands worth C$1.9 billion ($1.4 billion).
The gold sector, which makes up 10.5 percent of the key index, gained nearly 2.4 percent by the end of the session.
April gold prices on COMEX turned around from their losing position to close $3.50 higher at $345.40.
But Canada's largest equities market was kept in check by unexpected losses in the heavyweight banking sector. Investors decided to jump on the golds bandwagon and sell bank issues, take profits after the sector hit new heights this week.
"A little bit of the helium has escaped from that sector today," said ScotiaMcLeod's senior vice-president Fred Ketchen. "Everything else's showing strength, mirroring New York."
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices rose except for banks and real estate. Golds led the surge, followed by retail, utilities and consumer products.
Advancing stocks raced ahead of declines 545 to 437, while another 284 traded unchanged.
Gold stocks were active, including Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp., the world's second largest gold miner.
Bre-X President David Walsh said he was "positive" the prospector would reach an agreement with its Indonesian partners by the February 17 deadline, set by the Indonesian government. This will allow Bre-X and Barrick to develop a huge gold discovery in Busang.
Bre-X stock rose 0.45 to 22.70 while Barrick added 1.05 to reach 36.25, both in heavy trading.
Retailer Sears Canada Inc. topped Toronto's most actives, rising 0.40 to 11.95 on 2.6 million shares.
Automobile parts maker Magna International Inc. lost 1.45 to 71.35 on more than two million shares after an agressive U.S. seller shed a very large amount of stock.
