Computer Associates International Inc said Wednesday it would focus an increasing share of its resources on its midrange software business and reduce its reliance on mainframe software sales.
In addition, CA President Sanjay Kurmar said in a phone interview he expected a charge "in the $500 million range" related to the planned acquisition of Cheyenne Software Inc. It would be taken its quarter ending in December.
Kumar also said the company's international sales growth had "slowed some" in the quarter ended in September.  
He said the acquisition was likely to be accounted for as an asset purchase with a one-time writedown for research and development costs instead of a "pooling of interests."
Kumar was confirming comments he and other Computer Associates executives had made in a meeting with Wall Street analysts Wednesday morning.
Analysts who attended the meeting said news of the planned revenue transition and slowing in international sales led to a sharp drop in the company's stock. The decline came in spite of the announcement of fiscal second-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations.
