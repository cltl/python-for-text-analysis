Lauda Air is enjoying "huge passenger growth" on the Hong Kong to Vienna route but cargo is disappointing, the airline's Hong Kong general manager Sunny Yu told Reuters.
While there's been a 34 percent increase in the number of passengers along with a 42 percent growth in revenue over the past year, cargo revenue is up to three per cent below last year's level, he said. Lauda's Boeing 767-300 twice weekly flight from Hong Kong to Vienna via Bangkok averages eight to nine tonnes of belly cargo with watches a particularly common commodity, Yu said.
"Cargo is staying at more or less the same level as it was last year. A small price war and overcapacity with ad hoc charters operating into Hong Kong are major obstacles. I'm not optimistic about getting cargo rates back to the good old days," Yu said.
He said the cargo situation is not mirrored on the passenger side where Lauda expects another double digit rise in passenger numbers this year. The current number of passengers flying between Hong Kong and Vienna is around 9,000, Lauda says.
The Austria carrier also said it's being constricted in adding more frequencies to Hong Kong from its Vienna hub because of slot restrictions at Kai Tak airport but hopes to eventually benefit when the territory's new, round the clock airport opens in 18 months time. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017.
