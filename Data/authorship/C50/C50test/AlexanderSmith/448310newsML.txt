He said the group would be spending around 115 million stg on its existing portfolio and its developments.
"We have taken steps to ensure growth in the future...The UK market for shopping centres and offices is bouyant," he added.  
Spinney said there were signs the French market was in a similar position to where the British market had been about two years before, adding he was confident there had been rises in values since the end of the year in Britain.
Hammerson's gearing is currently "relatively modest" at 58 percent, Spinney said, adding that the group itended acquiring more properties over the year, this would be split between areas and sectors.
"We are generally happy with it (the split) as it is at the present time," he said.
