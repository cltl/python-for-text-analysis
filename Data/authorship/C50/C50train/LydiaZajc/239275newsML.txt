The Toronto stock market ended weaker on Friday, but recovered most of its losses after sinking nearly three percent on comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index fell 31.69 points to close 5810.06 after experiencing its worst intra-day decline in nine years.
The key index sank 171 points, the most severe fall since a 176.5-point decline on October 22, 1987.
Trading was moderate with 80.8 million shares changing hands worth C$1.4 billion (US$1.03 billion).
"For a volatile market that has been looking for a reason, any reason, to correct, last night's comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan were just the ticket," RBC Dominion Securities analyst Dunnery Best said in a report.
In a speech Thursday night, Greenspan warned that "irrational exuberance" was infecting financial markets, sparking heavy selling in equities markets worldwide.
By the end of Friday's session, Toronto recovered most of its losses, while the Dow Jones average lost 55.16 points.
