Heavy wet season rains in April favouring Ivorian cocoa midcrop growth (May-Sept) dropped off in early May but harvests are expected to match forecasts of over 150,000 tonnes, weather and crop analysts said on Thursday.
"Nothing much has really changed," said one crop analyst returning from upcountry and referring to favourable pod growth and flowering seen in early April. "The development seems to be coming along quite nicely."
Official weather data for the first 10 days of May totalled 292.6 mm against 789.2 mm in the previous 10 days.
Wet season rains, which arrived in April, are expected to peak in June before small dry season conditions in July and August.
Steady June rains would favour pod growth and bean sizes and help propel harvest volumes toward preliminary crop analyst mid-crop forecasts of between 150,000-200,000 tonnes.
"I would have hoped for a bit more soil moisture," said one crop analyst. Another said levels were around average for the time of year.
Early May rains were concentrated north of main cocoa growing areas, with a total of 338 mm falling around Odienne, Bouake and Bondoukrou, and are not included in the above data.
Ivory Coast produced a bumper 200,000 tonnes mid-crop in its record 1.2 million tonnes harvest year (Oct-Sept). This year's main crop (Oct-April) was close to one million tonnes when the season closed at the end of last month.
The latest data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the first 10 days of May in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days bracketed):
Daloa 44.4 (21.8), Gagnoa 12.0 (62.7), San Pedro 1.3 (49.4), Tabou 60.5 (95.4) Man 33.3 (12.5), Dimbokro 39.7 (41.8), Yamoussoukro 34.6 (69.0), Abidjan 35.1 (221.2), Sassandra 0 (154.7), Adiake 27.1 (51.7), Korhogo 4.6 (9.0).
