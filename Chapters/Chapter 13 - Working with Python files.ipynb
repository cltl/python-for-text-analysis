Other options are [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html) (for macOS) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (for Windows). A simple way to create a new .py file usually is to open a new file and save it as name_of_your_program.py (make sure to use indicative names). \n",
