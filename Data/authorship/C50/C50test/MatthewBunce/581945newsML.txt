French chocolate group CEMOI is building a new cocoa processing factory in Ivory Coast which will open in October 1997, the company's managing director said on Wednesday.
"The factory can process 60,000 tonnes of beans a year," Managing Director Patrique Poivrier told Reuters by telephone from CEMOI's headquarters at Perpignan, in the south of France. He put the cost of the project at 160 million French francs.
Ivory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual crop locally by the year 2000 to add export value and remove lower quality late season (May-Sept), or mid-crop, beans from international markets.
CEMOI's factory would open at its full capacity but could be upgraded to 120,000 tonnes after two years, producing cocoa liquor and cocoa cake and butter, Poivrier said. Work began at the construction site in northern Abidjan (Yopougon) on Friday, he added.
CEMOI, one of Europe's largest chocolate confectioners, uses 40,000 tonnes of raw cocoa beans a year and would sell products from the extra 20,000 tonnes capacity mainly to Europe and perhaps China.
"We are also looking at markets in China," he said.
Poivrier said the factory had been planned to secure a regular supply of good quality cocoa and by-pass Ivorian commodity exporters.
Ivory Coast already has three cocoa processing factories with capacity for processing up to 160,000 tonnes of beans a year.
Europe's Callebaut Barry group owns two factories. Ivorian exporter SIFCA owns a third, with some share participation from U.S.-based Arthur Daniels Midland. It plans to expand capacity by 21,000 tonnes by 1998.
Several other factory projects are nearing final planning stages.
U.S.-based Cargill will soon reach a decision on whether to go ahead with plans to build a 60,000 tonnes-capacity factory in partnership with Ivorian exporter SICC.
"There should be a decision in June," said a source close to the negotiations.
