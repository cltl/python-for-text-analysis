British Airways plans to offer more passenger flights to Hong Kong but will not be changing the current wet lease freighter service to the territory, said chief executive Robert Ayling.
"We quite successfully expanded our cargo business by bringing in quite a substantial proportion of freighter capacity from outside the airline and I don't see why that should not continue. It's true Hong Kong is a particularly good market for freight and I am sure the air cargo industry will continue in the future," Ayling told reporters in Hong Kong. He is visiting the territory as part of a tour of key BA destinations with the theme 'Taking British Airways into the new millennium.' promoting how he will be "reinventing" the airline
"We have had a firm policy for the past ten years not to buy freighters and I see no reason to change that. I think if you asked KLM and Lufthansa, they would prefer to be in my position. I think we will continue to operate freighters but only on a wet lease basis not involving any capital expenditure," he added.
BA says it currently offers a three times weekly service between London Gatwick and Hong Kong using a Boeing 747-200 freighter wet leased from Atlas Air Inc. It also has 14 Boeing 747-400 passenger flights a week to London offering belly cargo capacity. The airline says it hopes to increase the twice daily frequency when slots at Heathrow become available and before Hong Kong's new airport opens in 1998.
Rivals Virgin Atlantic recently said that it does not have enough capacity on the London to Hong Kong route and is considering replacing its popular but smaller Airbus A340 aircraft with higher capacity Boeing 747-400 aircraft to meet demand. But Virgin managers said it has no immediate plans to enter the freighter market. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
