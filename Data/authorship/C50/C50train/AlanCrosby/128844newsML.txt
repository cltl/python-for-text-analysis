Germany's David Prinosil, in a homecoming of sorts, overwhelmed Czech Petr Korda 6-1 6-2 in the final of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open on Sunday.
The 23-year-old German, who was born near here in Olomouc and emigrated to Germany when he was 14, took control of the match from the beginning, keeping Korda off balance with his booming serve and crisp groundstrokes.
As was the case all week, Prinosil used his deft return of service as an offensive weapon, seizing on both break points he had to take the first set in just 22 minutes.
It was more of the same in the second set, with world number 49 Korda taking more chances, but failing to unsettle the German, who was playing in only his second final on the tour after he won in Newport last year.
Korda was on the verge of breaking Prinosil in the fourth game, but the world number 58 blasted four straight service winners to take the game, and then ripped two crosscourt forehands to break in the fifth and seventh games in a match that lasted just 50 minutes.  
"If someone told me I wouldn't lose a set all week, I would have said they were crazy. I don't think I have ever played this well," said Prinosil, who enjoyed straight set victories over Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, American Todd Martin and Briton Tim Henman on his way to the final and a prize of $64,000.
Korda said: "I was a little drained from yesterday's match and he hit the ball well. The points were short, which gave me little chance to take control of the match."
Korda needed two hours late on Saturday to defeat Davis Cup team mate Martin Damm in three sets while Prinosil beat Henman in just 56 minutes.
