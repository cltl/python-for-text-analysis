Business at hotel to betting group Ladbroke Group Plc is going well, with some flickers of hope that conditions are picking up at its 38 hotels in mainland Europe, chief executive Peter George said in an interview.
"The same trend has continued in the last two months. The businesses are doing well. It does seem to be getting gradually better this year in mainland Europe," he said.
Earlier Ladbroke reported a 34 percent rise in calendar 1996 pretax, pre-exceptional profits to 163 million stg but trading profit from its European hotels fell slightly.
