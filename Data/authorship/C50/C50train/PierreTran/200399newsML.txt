The French government has cleared the way for state-owned Air France to buy Boeing long-haul passenger jets from the United states, as well as similar planes from French-based Airbus, an official source said on Tuesday.
The source told Reuters the clearance would come when the airline's board members meet on Wednesday to decide on its fleet acquisition after reports that the government would insist that the French flag carrier should get all its long-haul needs from French-based Airbus.
"We are inclined to a balanced solution between Airbus and Boeing," said the source on Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. "There should an agreement tomorrow."
The business newspaper Les Echos reported earlier on Tuesday that a committee of the Air France board was expected on Wednesday to recommend purchase of 10 Airbus A340-300 and 10 Boeing 777-200 jets for its long-range fleet,
Two other sources close to the talks said the split purchase was expected to be approved.
Transport minister Bernard Pons had so far been pushing airline chairman Christian Blanc into buying exclusively from French-based Airbus Industrie, rather than mixing the purchase with archrival Boeing, industry and union sources have said.
Apart from the symbolic value of the French flag carrier, which has received 20 billion francs ($4 billion) in state funds, buying a French-made product, the Boeing 777 and Airbus 340 are considered by some in the aerospace industry to be competing products.
But a crucial factor in Blanc's decision to press ahead with the Boeing buy was a previous order for seven 767-300 and eight 737-500 aircraft due for delivery between 1999 and 2001. Les Echos said a clause in the sale contract allowed conversion of these planes to other types.
That order was worth around $874 million and Air France would now like to use the option to convert to Boeing 777s. Otherwise it stood to lose its deposit if it reneged on the deal to buy the smaller planes, a second source familiar with the talks said.
A Transport Ministry spokeswoman said Blanc had met Pons on Monday to explain the company's position.
Air France and Airbus declined to comment.
An aerospace executive said the cost of introducing to the fleet a new plane such as the giant 777 twinjet would be an estimated $40 million and mean a broader range of aircraft to maintain, and therefore increasing costs.
The industry will look carefully to see whether Air France will place orders or options on its aircraft, as the airline could use a conversion option for a planned "stretched" version of the Airbus A340, termed the A340-600, and thus become a launch customer for the programme.
Airbus has made studies of the A340-600 a top priority, as it would boost capacity to 375 passengers in three classes from 295 in the current A340-300 version. The new plane would rival the Boeing 777-300, which seats between 368 amd 394, and older models of Boeing's cashcow, the 747 jumbo.
Boeing currently enjoys a monopoly in the large capacity segment, which Airbus is determined to rival with its own products.
Air France already flies the A340, which is a long-range, wide-body aircraft. ($1=5.086 French Franc)
