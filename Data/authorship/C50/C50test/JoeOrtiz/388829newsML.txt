The Woolwich Building Society, which on Wednesday announced its last set of results before a planned stock market flotation, said it sees growth in all its businesses.
But Chief Executive John Stewart said that if draft building societies legislation is passed in its current form, the Woolwich would have to consider expansion by acquisition very carefully.
This is because in its current form the law would take away a building society's five-year immunity from takeover, which they enjoy under present legislation, if they take over another financial sector company.
