Growth of 33.55 percent in near level two-way trade enabled Taiwan to become the second most important country in tonnage terms for air cargo traffic handled by Hong Kong airport, Civil Aviation Department statistics issued here show.
Dominated by high exports from Hong Kong, the U.S. kept its place at the top of list but the surge in Taiwan's trade, edged Japan to third place compared with the same month last year.
