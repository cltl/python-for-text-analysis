As China winds down from a two-week Spring Festival holiday and warmer weather looms, Far East metals traders forecast on Monday that demand for Chinese base metals would begin to pick up.
Some traders said physical tightness of some materials, especially copper and aluminium, would push premiums higher.
A trader based in Hong Kong with a major Chinese metals producing firm said mainland customers who had bought three months ahead of the new year holiday were now clamouring for nearby delivery.
"I will have to contact the LME (London Metal Exchange) and arrange to borrow because they want their 300 tonnes before the end of this month," he said.
"We're expecting our customers to buy, though many are holding on for price falls," he said, adding that high LME prices should soon prompt a profit-taking related correction.
Tightness in the Chinese domestic market was immediately evident on the Shanghai Metal Exchange, which resumed trading on Monday after the Lunar New Year holidays.  
Shanghai copper futures were sharply higher with the most active May 1997 contract opening at 21,980 yuan ($2,648) per tonne, up 400 yuan. It rose further to its limit-up of 22,100 yuan per tonne early in the session.
A source in Shanghai with a Western trading firm said the local exchange's stocks stood close to 20,000 tonnes, though this could hardly be considered high.
Aluminium futures also opened up, with the May contract first traded at 15,900 yuan per tonne, up 20 yuan.
Dips in the LME price of aluminium have prompted Chinese orders over the past two weeks, an industry executive said.
"My belief is that despite the fact that the Chinese were on holiday, there have been some Chinese orders going into the LME already," the executive said on condition of anonymity.
A long-awaited correction in the aluminium price had brought Chinese buyers out of their holiday cocoon, he said, adding however that he had no details of Chinese orders.
Aluminium prices on the LME have whipsawed recently. They sagged on Friday under commission house sales and liquidation after the market failed to respond to a 9,975-tonne draw down on stocks. Final kerb trade was at $1,565, down $11 per tonne.  
China's peak aluminium usage period coincides with summer when demand for airconditioners and refrigerators soars.
China's imports of unwrought aluminium and aluminium materials in 1996 rose by three percent, to 634,418 tonnes, from 1995's 615,749 tonnes, according to official figures.
Exports of unwrought aluminium and aluminium materials fell 34.1 percent in 1996 to 169,170 tonnes, from 256,744 tonnes in 1995.
