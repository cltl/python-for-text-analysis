Baxter International Inc is comfortable with the First Call consensus 1997 earnings forecast of $2.36 per share, compared to $2.11 per share for 1996, said Baxter chief financial officer Harry Kraemer.
In an interview Thursday with Reuters, Kraemer said, "We're very comfortable with that. I would say that's a very reasonable number."
He said the Deerfield, Ill.-based healthcare products giant expects 1997 revenues to be in the $6.5-billion range, up from $5.43 billion reported for 1996.  
"If you start off with the $5.5 billion that we have today, you add Immuno for another almost $700 million and you put in a little growth ... it would be fair to say we'd be somewhere in the $6.5 billion range for 1997," he said.
He said Baxter continues to anticipate closing its $623-million acquisition of Switzerland's Immuno International AG by mid-year.
The company expects to post charges on acquired in-process research and development related to buying Immuno and Research Medical Inc, Kraemer reiterated. But he said the size of those charges still has not been determined.  
He said closing of the $236-million acquisition of Research Medical is expected by the end of the first quarter.
Research Medical's results will not likely have an impact on Baxter's until the second quarter, he added.
"Immuno will be non-dilutive in '97 and will be accretive beginning in 1998. For RMI, which obviously is a much smaller transaction, it will be slightly dilutive in 1997 and will be accretive in 1998 and beyond," he said.
Baxter expects gross profit margin to rise this year over last. "I would expect to see our gross margin increase during 1997 ... as much as a half a point is realistic," he said.  
Gross profit margin was 44.6 percent for the quarter just ended, down from 46.2 percent a year earlier. "The fourth quarter of last year was much higher than our trends.... We just had a blip in the fourth quarter last year," he said.
Gross margin for 1996 was 44.7 percent, down from 45.0 percent in 1995. Baxter offset the decline by cutting selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales to 21.0 percent in 1996 from 21.5 percent in 1995, Kraemer said.
Sales in Baxter's renal business grew faster than in the past, in "low double digits" on the quarter, and hit $1.3 billion for the year, Kraemer said.  
The renal business consists primarily of clinics that sell dialysis services to patients with kidney disease. Baxter's chief competitor in the U.S. market is Fresenius AG.
In the United States, fourth-quarter renal sales were down "in low-single digits, virtually almost flat" compared to year-ago results, Kraemer said. The decline was less steep than in the third quarter, however, he said, adding there has been an easing in the price war with Fresenius.
"There was a significant price competition the first couple of quarters, which has now levelled out," he said.
For 1996, Baxter's cardiovascular group had sales of $855 million, the biotechnology group had sales of $1.3 billion, and the intravenous systems group had sales of $2 billion.
Looking ahead, Kraemer said Baxter expects sales to grow more than 20 percent in 1997. "We think we're going to generate at least an incremental $300-$400 million in cash flow. We will grow our net earnings after tax in the low double-digits. We do believe, beyond 1997, that we'll grow our earnings in 1998 and 1999 in the mid-teens," he said.
