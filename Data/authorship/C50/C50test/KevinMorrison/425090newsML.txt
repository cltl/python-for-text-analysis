Cinema and theme park operator Village Roadshow Ltd said it expected stronger second half earnings fuelled by the expansion of its cinema operations.
"The second half has already started stronger and we are going to start seeing the full six month contribution from the European acquisition and also the contribution from new cinemas we have opened up," group general manager Peter Foo told Reuters in an interview.
Village earlier reported a 27 percent rise in net profit to A$26.1 million for the 1996/97 first half.  
Foo said the group was always looking at new opportunities for its cinema expansion, but he would not add if the company was looking at any new countries for expansion.
Cinemas account for the single largest revenue contribution from Village's operation, with about 40 percent of the A$172.95 million in 1996/97 first half sales coming from cinemas.
The remainder its split between radio and theme parks.
Foo said Village was not interested in acquiring the resort island businesses of Qantas Airways Ltd, which the airline has up for sale. The resorts include Great Keppel, Brampton, Bedarra and Lizard Islands offshore Queensland.  
"We are not interested at this stage, we want to focus on our cinema rollout," Foo said. He said the company was happy with its existing holiday resort business, Daydream Island.
Village is about 19 percent owned by MAI Plc, a unit of United News and Media Plc. Foo said Village was looking at working with the British media group in some areas.
"We are looking at more co-production work," Foo said. Village also has film and television production operations.
Village's radio interests are held through its 53 percent stake in Austereo Ltd, which announced earlier an 11 percent rise in 1996/97 first half profit to A$17.15 million.  
Village shares closed one cent higher at A$4.26.
