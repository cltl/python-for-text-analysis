New York and Los Angeles are safe at one and two respectively. \n\nHouston has long been associated with the risk takers in the oil industry and more recently as one of the better cities to find a job. \n\n\u201cTexas has a long tradition, and Houston has it in spades, that we are not so much interested in where you are from. We want to know what you can do,\u201d Houston Mayor Annise Parker said in an interview with Reuters. \n\nChicago officials were not immediately available for comment. \n\nApart from domestic migration, about one in five Houstonians is foreign born and more than 90 languages are spoken in the city. \n\n\u201cWe have that international mindset that the rest of the United States never saw,\u201d said Parker, a former oil executive and city controller who has a collection of urban achievement awards and rodeo belt buckles in her office. \n\nOn Houston\u2019s fringes are petrochemical plants that fuel the economy, space agency NASA that attracts aerospace jobs and a port that handles more foreign tonnage than any other in the United States. \n\nIn between is a mass of relatively unplanned urban sprawl, strip malls, ethnic enclaves, trendy restraints and burgeoning green spaces lying under an umbrella of oppressive heat that lasts more than half the year. \n\nROLLER COASTER ECONOMY \n\nThe energy industry, which accounts for about 40 percent of Houston\u2019s economy, has sent the fortunes of the city on a roller coaster ride for decades. \n\nWith oil currently at around $45 a barrel, the brakes have been slammed on job growth, and a slight chill has entered into the booming construction sector. \n\nSince 1969, Houston has been one of the most successful major U.S. cities in terms of per capita personal income growth. Since about 2003, about 650,000 jobs have been created in the Houston area, according to the University of Houston. \n\nThe Houston-area unemployment rate has remained below the national average for years, according to government data, while the Chicago-area has recently been above it. \n\nHowever, Houston\u2019s growth, coming with few zoning restrictions and a loose regulatory system in Texas, has led to persistent problems in air quality and traffic congestion. \n\n\u2018HOW THE HELL DID THAT HAPPEN?\u2019 \n\nMayor Parker, who is leaving office after six years due to term limits, made headlines when she was elected the first open lesbian to run a major U.S. city. She capitalized on the media attention as a chance to promote the city as a good place to do business, she said. \n\nThe city purchases more renewable energy than any other in the United States, said Parker, who has launched a $250 million project to put bike and hike trials along the bayous, or small rivers, that run through the city like veins. \n\nOn social issues, residents in one of the most racially diverse U.S. cities are seen as \u201ctolerant traditionalists\u201d who espouse conservative values and open minds when it comes to social issues, according to a poll from the Kinder Institute for Urban Research at Houston\u2019s Rice University. \n\nResidents generally have a positive view of immigrants, favor same-sex marriage and are more progressive than the state\u2019s socially conservative Republican leadership, it said. \n\nThe city ranks near the top in the United States in terms of resettling refugees from abroad and when the price of oil picks up again, it will see a fresh wave of migration from those seeking employment. \n\n\u201cIf you see the way the crowd is going, you might as well jump in front of it and make it a parade,\u201d Parker said. \n\n(This story has been refiled to add dropped word \u201cby\u201d in second paragraph) \n\n(Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Additional reporting by Terry Wade; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) \nPolitics & Government Houston United States Chicago", "source": "Gnom.es"}
