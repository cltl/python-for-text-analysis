LucasVarity Plc, the U.S.-Anglo auto components giant formed in September, announced a major restructuring Tuesday, including the planned disposal of 13 non-core businesses and the elimination of 3,000 jobs over two years.
LucasVarity said it had identified a range of additional moves that will mean an extra 120 million British pounds ($200 million) in profit benefits -- double the level anticipated just three months ago when the company was formed in the merger of Lucas Industries of Britain and Varity Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y.
Worldwide employment will be cut by 3,000 over the next two years as a result of the moves, the company said.
LucasVarity said it also will take an extra one-time charge of 130 million pounds ($217 million), mainly in non-cash items, along with 120 million pounds ($200 million) in charges already planned for this year.
Thirteen companies were identified for sale in a three-month post-merger review, although only eight were named in the restructuring announcement -- all small businesses in Britain, Argentina and South Africa.
Chief Executive Victor Rice said in an interview that the company was "sifting through some offers" and expected to be in "active negotiations" on the sale of some of the 13 units quite soon.
Rice said major businesses like aerospace and electronics were not among the unnamed five.
The criteria for divestment were those firms which "neither fitted into the core strategy of the company or contributed economic added value," Rice said.
Rice, who came from Varity, said the post-divestment savings were "virtually double" original expectations.
LucasVarity is involved in the design, manufacture and supply of systems, products and services in international automotive, diesel engine, aftermarket and aerospace industries.
Both parties in the merger specialised in braking systems and industry sources expected that many of the measures would affect production and employment in these units.
