Michael Foods Inc said Wednesday it is considering options for its potato operations, including possibly divesting the business that includes frozen french fries and refrigerated potatoes.
"We're going to be looking over the next couple of quarters as to what we're going to do with that total potato business," Gregg Ostrander, president, said in an interview here.  
The options being explored by the company, whose largest business is extended shelf-life and processed eggs, include potentially divesting the entire potato operation.
"That's one of the things we're going to explore," Ostrander said. "We're going through a lot of options now."
He said no decisions have been made as yet.
Michael Foods was among the companies presenting at an analyst conference here. Its potato product business accounted for 12 percent of the company's operating earnings in 1995.  
Minnesota-based Michael Foods is currently "number seven or eight" in frozen french fries, which continues to operate in the red, Ostrander said.
Its refrigerated potato product business is the leader in both the retail and food service categories, and continues to grow, but at a slower rate than previously, he said.
The company posted an operating profit in 1995 of $35.2 million and net earnings of $17.6 million.
Michael Foods continues to grow its egg products business, which accounted for 59 percent of its operating earnings in 1995. The company will soon close on its acquisition of Papetti's Hygrade Egg Products Inc, extending its product line in food service and retail liquid eggs.
While Papetti's and Michal Foods egg businesses will be run separately, Ostrander said he sees the potential to reap $8 million to $15 million in synergies, starting in the fourth quarter of this year.
The Papetti's deal will give Michael Foods access to East Coast egg processing operations, complementing its existing Midwest operations.
