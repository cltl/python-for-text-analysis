Shares of food and beverage giant PepsiCo Inc rose sharply Thursday on rumors that it could be a takeover target of Philip Morris Cos Inc.
Industry experts flatly dismissed the rumor, saying a pricetag on any potential transaction would be an astounding $60 to $80 billion.
Instead, they said the rumor, just the latest to surface about PepsiCo in recent months, underscores widespread dissatisfaction about the company's outlook.  
"I don't ever say no to anything, but I think this is a farfetched rumor," said Martin Romm of CS First Boston.
Officials from PepsiCo and Philip Morris declined to comment on the rumor, citing company policy.
But shares of PepsiCo, which have been active recently, jumped 1-3/8 to 30-1/2 and Philip Morris gained 1-1/8 to 97. Wall Street rumblings began earlier this week and the rumor picked up steam after a Thursday report in the New York Post.  
The New York Post cited a rumor on Wall Street that Philip Morris would offer $50 a share for PepsiCo.
The speculation of a deal with Philip Morris comes less than one month after PepsiCo announced a major plan to pull out of weak international beverage markets.
The restructuring, which called for a charge of more than $500 million against earnings, also included cost-cutting targets and continued focus on its Frito-Lay snack food unit.  
But Wall Street is disappointed with the company's indecision about its casual restaurant business, which has performed below expectations. PepsiCo said it is reviewing those operations and analysts widely expect the company to eventually sell the business.
In the meantime, earnings growth will rest heavily on the strong Frito-Lay division.  
"In 1997, a large (part of PepsiCo earnings) is going to be riding on the shoulders of Frito-Lay. Frito-Lay, in my opinion, has to deliver next year," said Skip Carpenter of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, who does not anticipate a major turnaround for the international beverage business until 1998 or 1999.
Analysts said PepsiCo reported third quarter earnings on Tuesday that met expectations, but failed to excite investors.
If PepsiCo sells the restaurant business as expected, the company may pour some of those proceeds into acquisitions to further beef up the solid snack food business, analysts said.  
Analysts also have dismissed recent rumors that PepsiCo would be interested in buying Starbucks Corp. They said a transaction between the two would likely dilute PepsiCo earnings and disappoint investors who want the company to exit the casual dining business.
Both companies declined to comment on the PepsiCo-Starbucks speculation. The two companies are in a joint venture for the production and sale of a cold coffee beverage called Frappucino.  
Philip Morris' huge product line includes Post breakfast cereals, Marlboro cigarettes and Kraft cheese.
