    "# Topic 3 - Diving into files and data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will learn how to deal with files and data formats in Python. You probably have heard of (or are already quite familiar with) different data formats, such as plain text, tables (CSV/TSV), XML, JSON and RDF. These formats are simply the result of agreements that were made between people on how to organize and store data. Some of these formats, such as XML and RDF, have a high degree of structure, whereas plain text is a typical example of unstructured data. Structuring data according to predefined specifications allows information in the data to be easily ordered and processed by machines. You can compare highly structured data with a perfectly organized filing cabinet where everything is identified, labeled and easy to access. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces some of the existing data formats, and explains how you can work with files stored locally on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**At the end of this week, you will be able to:**\n",
    "- open and read the contents of one or multiple `text` and `csv/tsv` files;\n",
    "- manipulate the content of files (e.g. sentence splitting, tokenization, POS-tagging, and lemmatization);\n",
    "- write new or manipulated content to new (or existing) files;\n",
    "- read and write JSON data; \n",
    "- import and use modules like `csv`, `json`, `nltk`, `os` and `glob`;\n",
    "- write a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This requires that you already have (some) knowledge about:**\n",

    "\n",
    "When doing text analysis, you will often work with files that contain plain text. These files typically end with the `.txt` extension. In Python, you can read the content of a file, store it as the type of object that you need (string, list, etc.) and manipulate it (e.g. replacing or removing words). You can also write new content to an existing or a new file. Refer to [Chapter 2](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Python-chapters/chapter-2.md) of this course for a summary about reading and writing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Reading (and closing) files\n",
    "Let's start with opening a file in Python. To do this, we need to associate the file on disk with a variable in Python. First, we tell Python where the file is stored on your disk. The location of your file is often referred to as the file path. Python will start looking in the 'working' or 'current' directory (which often will be where your Python script is). If it's in the working directory, you only have to tell Python the name of the file (e.g. `charlie.txt`). If it's not in the working directory, as in our case, you have to tell Python the exact path to your file. We will create a string variable to store this information:"

We had to open the file, read the contents, tokenize the text, and use the POS tagger (remember, we first needed to import `nltk` to be able to use it). we can now write a single function that does all that for us. The following function reads the specified file and returns the tokens with their POS tags:"
