A top executive of Tyco International Ltd on Monday vowed that the company would not pursue a hostile takeover of American Standard Cos Inc, which last month rejected its unsolicited merger offer.
"Tyco historically has not done hostile takeovers, and we are not going to do a hostile takeover here. We're off and doing other things. As far as we're concerned, it's past history," Senior Vice President David Brownell told Reuters in a telephone interview.  
However, Brownell said Tyco would still welcome friendly talks with American Standard.
"If the American Standard management would like to speak with us, we would be happy to speak with them," he said.
Brownell said that Tyco has not tried to contact American Standard since its December offer was rejected.
American Standard earlier disclosed that it had received the offer from Tyco but had determined that it wanted to remain independent. It also said it did not plan to hold any discussions with Tyco.
Tyco had offered $50 per share, or about $3.9 billion, for American Standard in a combination of stock and cash.
Shares of American Standard, which had rallied more than 4 in early trade, were up 3-1/4 to 43-1/2 by midafternoon.
Tyco shares were unchanged at 54-5/8.
