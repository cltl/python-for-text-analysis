British Airways said it will be able to carry an extra 70 tonnes of air cargo a week when its twice-daily passenger services between Hong Kong and London begin a new, shorter route over China later this month.
Chris Humphrey, BA's regional cargo manager Pacific said the new northern route over Chinese air space will mean shorter journey times for BA's Boeing 747-400 aircraft which won't need to carry as much fuel enabling the cargo payload to be increased by five to six tonnes per flight on average.
He said the new routing was negotiated during recent talks between the Chinese and British governments and also benefits BA's rivals on the route, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Virgin Atlantic. Both Cathay Pacific and Virgin Atlantic said they are also due to start the new shorter route on October 27.
"The new routing via Urumqi in China will be a real benefit to us with the start of our winter schedule on October the 27th. It means a shorter distance, less fuel and more cargo. With the extra capacity it will generate of around 70 tonnes a week which is very close to getting another 747 freighter on the route," Humphrey said.
