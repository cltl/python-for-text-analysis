Czech engineering group Skoda a.s. said Tuesday it won an order to supply more than $170 million in buses to the city of San Francisco, the largest supply of Czech goods ever to the United States.
Skoda spokesman Jaroslav Hudec said the electric-powered buses would be produced in the Czech Republic and assembled at Skoda's subsidiary, Electric Transit International in Baltimore.
"We consider victory in this tender to be an extraordinary success not only in view of the expected volumes of supplies ... but also because the U.S. market is among the most prestigious and demanding in the world," Hudec said.
Plzen-based Skoda, no longer affiliated with the Czech car maker Skoda Automobilova a.s., has made an aggressive push into new markets, aiming to offer western-quality units with the comparative cost advantage of eastern European production.
The San Francisco contract would open the way for Skoda, an engineering conglomerate that makes goods ranging from nuclear power components to drink cans, to win more business in the United States, Hudec said.
"Considering the ecologization of public transport in the U.S., Skoda Plzen has real chances to win further orders ... and also bring the brand Skoda to the U.S. market in relation to other production of our factories," he said.
Skoda has made over 12,000 buses since 1936 -- many of which run in cities throughout the former communist bloc.
Local Czech media reports quoted ETI officials as saying the San Francisco order could be for about 250 single-section and higher capacity buses.
The total order will be finalised by mid-year, Hudec said.
Earlier this decade Skoda won a contract to supply 54 buses to the city of Dayton, Ohio, and founded ETI, a U.S. joint venture with private partners in Baltimore, to assemble the buses. Skoda holds a majority stake in ETI.
The Dayton project is to be completed in 1998. Skoda said it is also pursuing joint ventures to build buses in Russian and Iran.
