Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (HACTL) is considering marketing its knowhow to developing airports around the world, managing director Anthony Charter told Reuters.
During a visit to Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok(CLK) Charter said HACTL may diversify by marketing its expertise built up over the past 20 years.
It may also start to license its sophisticated air cargo handling software, he added.
Industry sources said HACTL is acknowledged to be one of the world leaders in operating air cargo handling facilities and that Kai Tak, already the second largest for international airfreight, is also one of the most efficient.
HACTL may also be interested in becoming a joint venture partner, Charter added.
"Now we are in the execution phase of the new cargo terminal (at CLK) we are beginning slowly to have planning resources with experience available. When we have the time, I think we may start considering marketing services to other airports. Bangkok is obviously one where it would be interesting to be involved," Charter said.
The marketing venture -- possibly a separate unit within HACTL to work on individual projects -- could become a highly profitable offshoot, he added.
"I think we have perhaps been too reticent about marketing our product and we will certainly be looking into it and exploring the idea," Charter said.
Up to now, HACTL planners have been establishing and fine tuning its existing twin terminals at Kai Tak airport. The planning team has also been busy designing HACTLs HK$7.8 billion state of the art SuperTerminal 1 at CLK.
This has a a design capacity of 2.6 million tonnes a year of air cargo and the company says it will be the largest and most advanced facility of its kind in the world when it comes into service in 1998. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel + 44-171-542-7706 Fax +44-171-542-5017
