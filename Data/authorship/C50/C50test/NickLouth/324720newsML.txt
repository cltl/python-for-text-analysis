AT&amp;T Corp. is earning more, but having trouble getting paid.
The nation's largest telephone company said Wednesday that operating profits from continuing operations for the last quarter of 1996 rose 14 percent, but said it had to put aside $200 million to cover unpaid bills by customers.
The telecommunications company, which has now completed its split into three major units, said it earned $1.24 billion, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $1.09 billion, or 68 cents a share, in 1995's last quarter.
Chief financial officer Richard Miller told Wall Street analysts in a conference call that results for the first quarter of 1997 would be comparable or slightly above those of the fourth quarter.
Revenues in the latest period rose to $13.24 billion from $12.89 billion.
The Basking-Ridge, N.J.-based company's 1995 fourth-quarter operating profits excluded restructuring and other charges totalling $2.036 billion, or $1.27 a share. Including these charges, its net earnings from continuing operations resulted in a loss of $948 million, or 59 cents a share.
Competition has brought the company a new headache.
"It used to be if you don't pay your phone bill you didn't get phone service. Now with multiple suppliers, we can shut off their service, but they can go someplace else to get service," Miller told Reuters.
The problem is worst among business users, particularly the hundreds of tiny long-distance resellers, some of whom go bankrupt after ordering millions of network minutes from carriers like AT&amp;T, MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. in order to compete with them.
AT&amp;T's fourth-quarter operating net per share was three cents below the 79 cents industry analysts had forecast, according to First Call, mainly on the extra $200 million in provisions for bad debts.
As a result, some analysts lowered their 1997 estimates.
"No one was expecting that," said Bear Stearns analyst Bette Massick. "You have to cut your number on that alone."
For all of 1996, AT&amp;T's income from continuing operations rose to $5.6 billion from $5.2 billion for 1995, excluding the charges. Earnings per share for 1996 were $3.47, a 5.5 percent increase over $3.29 per share in 1995.
Total 1996 revenues were $52.2 billion, a 3 percent increase over 1995's $50.7 billion.
"AT&amp;T had a record year in 1996 in the face of extraordinary challenges and unprecedented changes in our business and in our industry," said Chairman Robert E. Allen.
In September 1995, AT&amp;T said it would restructure its businesses, spinning off equipment company Lucent Technologies in September, and it completed with the spinoff of computer company NCR at the end of 1996.
AT&amp;T also sold its majority position in AT&amp;T Capital Corporation to a consortium of investors during the year.
AT&amp;T said its communications services revenue increased $529 million in the latest quarter, up 4.3 percent from the same period last year. Communications services revenues include wireline services and wireless services, as well as communications products and other services.
It said its long-distance calling volumes grew 6 percent over the same period in 1995 and 1.8 percent over the previous quarter.
"The growth in traffic volumes (3.2 percent) was better than the 2.5 percent we were expecting," said analyst Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. "But they are still losing market share to the tune of three percentage points a year," he said.
AT&amp;T's wireless services revenue, which includes cellular voice and data, messaging and air-to-ground services, grew 18.4 percent to $937 million in the fourth quarter of 1996. Its cellular service subscribers grew to 5.2 million, a 31.7 percent increase from a year ago.
Revenues from communications products and other services, which include consulting and outsourcing, on-line, and wireless product sales, were $386 million, an increase of nearly 17 percent from the year-ago quarter.
However, credit card revenue plunged 32.3 percent to $374 million, primarily as a result of the securitization programme instituted at AT&amp;T Universal Card Services in 1995.
Credit card operating losses fell to $4 million in the fourth quarter from $35 million in the third quarter of 1996. In 1995's fourth quarter, it made an operating profit of $109 million.
AT&amp;T's stock closed 50 cents down at $38.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
