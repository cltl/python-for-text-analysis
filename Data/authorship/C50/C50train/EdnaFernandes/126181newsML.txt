AMEC Plc, the British building group, said late on Friday that expected to issue details of its possible investment in France's Spie Batignolle by November, predicting it would be wrapped up by the end of the year.
Peter Mason, chief executive, said an envisaged initial stake would probably be followed by a decision to take on a larger controlling share "in a number of years time, and I'm not talking one or two years."
Spie Batignolles is a currently a unit of holding company Schneider SA.  
That would be followed by a decision on whether to float part of it off. The amount to be floated would depend on various factors, he said.
"There will be negotiations between the management and us on how much we will retain and what to float. It will also depend on the state of the (stock) market at the time," said AMEC's chief executive.
He said the deal had been under discussion for some months and represented a good fit. An eventual combined group would have 5.0 billion stg of sales and give AMEC access to key new markets in areas like oil and gas and pharmaceuticals.  
It will also act as a springboard for AMEC into new regions, notably Indonesia, South America and South Africa.
"At present 70 percent of our business is in the UK," said Mason. But the new deal will mean that the combined group has 40 percent U.K. exposure, 30 percent French exposure with the remainder in world sales.
"One important concept is that there is little overlap between the two groups," Mason added.
He admitted that the greater exposure to France came as the market was suffering from very tough conditions, but he said that AMEC was "buying at the bottom, not at the top."
The deal is currently at due diligence stage.
