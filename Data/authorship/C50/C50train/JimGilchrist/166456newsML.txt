China Southern Airlines is ready to start its first European service to Amsterdam on November 26, Ma Ting Wei, manager of the airline's advertising division told Reuyters.
Speaking at China's first air show held at the showpiece Zhuhai airport about 35 miles across the Pearl River delta from Hong Kong, Ma also said China Southern plans to start flying to Los Angeles in the middle of March next year. But plans to start a third international destination to Brisbane in Australia have not yet been finalised, he said.
The twice weekly non-stop service to Amsterdam and the Los Angeles link will both use Boeing 777 aircraft, two of which have arrived and two more will be flown into the carrier's home airport of Guangzhou within the next two months, Ma said.
Speaking through an interpreter, Ma said the new European destination will be the airline's 26th international route which opens up new opportunities.
"We hope it will be a success and is in response to customer demand. We expect good passenger and cargo numbers to be carried," he said.
The Amsterdam service is the result of an Air Service Agreement between the Dutch and Chinese governments which industry observers say took five years to hammer out. The agreement also allowed Dutch flag carrier KLM to fly to Beijing and Dutch cargo airline Martinair to fly a 747 freighter service into Guangzhou. A Martinair spokesman told Reuters last week that the service was due to begin this month but could not give a definite start date.
Freight forwarders say both the China Southern and Martinair connection will mean cargo which up to now had to be flown from Hong Kong to Europe will now eliminate cross border expense and save time. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+44 171 542-5017
