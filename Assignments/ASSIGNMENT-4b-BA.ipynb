    "### Preparation (nothing to submit):\n",
    "To be able to answer the VADER questions you need to know how the tool works. \n",
    "* Read more about the VADER tool in [this blog](http://t-redactyl.io/blog/2017/04/using-vader-to-handle-sentiment-analysis-with-social-media-text.html).  \n",
    "* VADER provides 4 scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound). Be sure to understand what they mean and how they are calculated.\n",
    "* VADER uses rules to handle linguistic phenomena such as negation and intensification. Be sure to understand which rules are used, how they work, and why they are important.\n",
    "* VADER makes use of a sentiment lexicon. Have a look at [the lexicon](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt). Be sure to understand which information can be found there (lemma?, wordform?, part-of-speech?, polarity value?, word meaning?) What do all scores mean? You can inspect [the README](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) of the VADER system for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following sentences and their output as given by VADER. Analyze sentences 1 to 7, and explain the outcome **for each sentence**. Take into account both the rules applied by VADER and the lexicon that is used. You will find that some of the results are reasonable, but others are not. Explain what is going wrong or not when correct and incorrect results are produced. \n",
