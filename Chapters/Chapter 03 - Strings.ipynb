    "The first thing you learned was printing a simple sentence: \"Hello, world!\" This sentence, as any other **text**, was stored by Python as a **string**. Since many disciplines within the Humanities and Social Sciences work with texts, quite naturally we will focus a lot on **manipulating and analyzing texts** in this course. In addition, generally use strings to point to files on out computer (so-called filepaths) or use urls to point to websites (more on both later). Therefore, being able to manipulate strings is a central component of this course (which will come back in the following blocks). This Notebook is devoted to this object type.\n",

    "#### At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "* define *strings* and understand their *internal representation*\n",
    "* understand strings as *sequences*\n",
    "* use character indices for *string slicing*\n",
    "* combine strings through *printing, concatenation and insertion*\n",
    "* compare strings using *comparison operators* and the *in operator*\n",
    "* understand strings as *immutable* objects\n",
    "* work with and understand *string methods*\n",
