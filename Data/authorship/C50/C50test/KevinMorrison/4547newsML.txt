Qantas Airways Ltd is expected to fly slightly above its prospectus net profit forecast of A$237 million for the year to June 30, 1996 but analysts said 1996/97 results could hit some turbulence over current wage talks.
Australian aviation analysts expect Qantas to report an annual net profit before abnormals of between A$237 million and A$249 million. The airline is expected to pay a second half dividend of 13 cents, making a total of 16.5 for the year.  
Analysts said the Qantas result would be helped by lower costs, on which the airline has focussed since it became a publicly-owned company in July 1995.
"We have got an official figure of A$237 (million), but I really expect it to be around the A$240 to A$245 million mark and that would be largely driven by the cash flow being steered towards paying off debt," a Melbourne analyst said.
ANZ McCaughan aviation analyst Yasmin Allen expects Qantas to report a profit of A$237 million for 1995/96. "I would not be surprised to see it come in above that," Allen told Reuters.  
Another Melbourne-based aviation analyst forecast Qantas to report a net profit right on the prospectus forecast of A$237 million while one Sydney-based analyst forecast a net profit before abnormals of A$239.1 million for the year.
"They have done well on the cost reduction side and they have seen the market grow, but they have lost market share, so add all that up and I think they will come out about square," the second Melbourne-based analyst said.
Last week the Department of Transport released data showing that Qantas, including wholly-owned Australia Asia Airlines, had a 37.9 percent international market share in April.  
Qantas, which is 25 percent owned by British Airways Plc, forecast in its 1995 prospectus that its international market share would be 41.1 percent for the June 30, 1996 year.
Qantas, known as the 'flying Kangaroo' estimated a one percentage point variation from this forecast would affect the bottom line profit by A$48 million.
However, analysts said they were more interested in comments about Qantas' outlook for the 1996/97 year, as costs may increase, arising from current wage talks, renewed domestic competition, and continued pressure on international routes.  
Qantas has offered an eight percent pay rise over two years over two years on condition that productivity reforms are implemented, but unions want productivity gains to be rewarded by a wage rise over and above the eight percent offer.
Qantas shares took a dive to a record low of A$1.87 on July 24 as the market got the jitters that management had conceded to union pressure and award a wage rise above eight percent.
The unions initially made a claim for two consecutive annual wage rises of 10 percent but last month, Qantas chief executive James Strong said this claim would wipe out the airline's profit if successful.  
Qantas shares have now moved back to familiar territory and on Tuesday were trading at A$2.17.
Analysts expect Qantas to report a net profit before abnormals of between A$260 million to A$273 million for 1996/97, but some analysts said they would be ready to mark down these numbers if there were some very negative comments from Qantas.
They said the planned purchase by Air New Zealand Ltd of a 50 percent stake in local airline Ansett Airlines Ltd may pressure the 1996/97 results  
"People have known what 96 will look like but 97 is going to be a different story for a whole mix of things and there should also be some impact from a combined Ansett/Air New Zealand when that starts to happen later this year," the Sydney analyst said.
