Britain's United Biscuits (Holdings) Plc expects its margins in Europe to remain firm and to move up over the next two to three years, said managing director Eric Nicoli.
"We expect margins to move to 10 percent in all our businesses over a two or three year period," said Nicoli in an interview. UB margins are currently at around 10 percent in Britain and four percent in mainland Europe.
(Corrects to make clear company isn't expecting European margins alone to move by 10 percent over the next two to three years.)
Earlier the company reported a more than doubling in pretax, pre-exceptional annual profits to 109.1 million stg. UB shares were 7-1/2p higher at 246p in early trade.  
UB has now entered a phase of consolidation, after a hectic disposal programme, which means the emphasis is on organic growth, said Nicoli.
Over the last two years the company has sold its American snack operation Keebler, pulled out of Portugal and exited from Spanish snacks. It has also sold one of its Italian snack businesses, withdrawn from Turkey and Brazil and sold Ross Vegetables Products business in Britain.  
"The emphasis on organic growth as we are now in a consolidation phase," said Nicoli.
When asked about the outlook for the company he said, "Our markets continue to be very competitive but we expect another year of good progress."
In Britain, there is a trend among shoppers to switch into higher value lines against a background of improved consumer confidence, said Nicoli.
In mainland Europe, he said the company's businesses will improve but it did not expect any help from the markets.
