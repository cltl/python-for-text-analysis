British drug discovery group Scotia Holdings Plc said on Tuesday it remained confident about prospects for its drug pipeline despite recent setbacks.
In a telephone interview with Reuters, chief executive David Horrobin said the company believed troubled diabetic drug Tarabetic would win approval in Britain, despite a formal rejection by the UK's Medicines Control Agency.
"We are internally confident that we have the evidence to respond to the MCA's concerns," said Horrobin.  
He said he also believed the drug would not have to be marketed with a weakened labelling indication for its use, as some analysts have suggested. "It will be some variation of nerve damage in diabetes," he said.
The MCA's rejection of Tarabetic sent shares in Scotia plunging earlier this month, amid fears that the group would be forced into a rights issue in unfavourable circumstances.
But Horrobin also told Reuters that Scotia would not resort to a rights issue before the end of 1997 or 1998 at the earliest, helping take some pressure off the shares, which rose 36 pence to 415 by midmorning, recovering from early losses.  
He said trials of Foscan, currently in Phase III trials in Europe for head and neck cancer, were going well, with 250 patients recruited compared with 115 a year ago.
"We are getting the same results as you would get with surgical excision of early stage cancer," he said.
Horrobin also said the company was excited about Amelorad, a drug for alleviating the effects of radiation therapy on the skin and red blood cells.
"The one-year data is considerably stronger than the six to 12 week data, and shows substantial reductions in skin damage" in breast cancer, Horrobin said.
