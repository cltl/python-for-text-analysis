A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Once you have defined a function, you can use it at any place in your Python script. You can even import a function from an external module (as we will see in the next chapter). Therefore, they are beneficial for tasks that you will perform more often. Plus, functions are a convenient way to order your code and make it more readable!\n",
