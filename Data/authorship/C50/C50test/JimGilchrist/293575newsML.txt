Martinair has begun its "historic" freighter service between Guangzhou and Amsterdam, the Dutch airline's Far East general manager, Walter Tseng said.
Tseng told Reuters in an interview, that he expects the new service will be slowly built up after initial flights on December 20 and 29.
"The first two flights were a combination of local cargo supported by cargo from Hong Kong and topped up in Bangkok so it was shared by three hubs which we are using to slowly build up the Guangzhou service."
"You have to remember Guangzhou is nothing compared to Hong Kong which is the traditional entry point. Because we have such strong competition from Hong Kong it takes a little time to convince shippers. In China the main problem is the red tape and documentation but they picking it up very fast," Tseng added.
The Dutch cargo carrier became the first European airline to be allowed to fly scheduled services into the southern Chinese city after twice being postponed in October and November because of "licensing and equipment" delays.
After a New Year holiday suspension, Martinair said it will begin a regular scheduled service proper on January 23 and every Friday after that. Also as a result of lengthy Government negotiations, Guangzhou based China Southern Airlines won permission to begin its first European service to Amsterdam.
Martinair, which earlier described the new Boeing 747-200 link via Bangkok and Abu Dhabi as a "historic" new link said it aims to capture a profitable portion of the air cargo market to Europe from the booming Pearl River delta region of southern China. Up to now most European bound air cargo from southern China is trucked over the border and flown from Hong Kong. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
