Peter Jarvis, who announced he would be stepping down as chief executive of leisure and brewing group Whitbread Plc in the summer, paid tribute to his successor David Thomas as an inspired retailer.
"He is a retailer. He has been in retail all his life. I am not a retailer. I devised the retail strategy. I was a marketer, I was in ads until I was fourty. But David knows the retail business like the back of his hand."
Whitbread is now embarking on a period of organic growth driven by its retail brands which Thomas is best suited to orchestrate, said Jarvis.
