Air Canada is interested in opening up new Asian destinations including Tokyo and Singapore, said the airline's president and chief executive officer Lamar Durrett.
In a speech to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, reputed by members to be the largest outside Canada, Durrett said the airline is looking forward to future competition with Asian carriers hopefully with the help of open skies agreements.
He said the airline was positioning itself to become a long-term participant with a major expansion of services to customers across the Asia-Pacific region.
"The steadily increasing trade and travel links between Asia, Europe and North America are creating more opportunities for more carriers to offer passenger and cargo services. The Hong Kong-Canada market is a perfect example," Durrett said, pointing out that there had been a 41 percent increase in trans-Pacific capacity with the introduction of the airline's winter schedule.
Speaking to reporters after his speech, Durrett said he would like to expand services into Japan -- Air Canada currently flies to Osaka in partnership with ANA -- and also to fly to Tokyo and other Asian destinations.
"I don't expect we will open up a new Asia city in 1997, although we never say never, but we are interested in Singapore, Indonesia and have a big interest in China. We think the Asian market will continue to grow at 8-9 per cent annually so it is a high growth market. Clearly you look to the future and the future is going to be Asian," he said.
Air Canada said it also pressing the Canadian government to allow daily services between Hong Kong and Vancouver and Toronto instead of being restricted to the current four times weekly service.
