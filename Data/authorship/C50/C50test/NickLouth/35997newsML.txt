Citizens Utilities Co said on Thursday that it is aiming to be among the largest eight or 10 U.S. telephone companies by the year 2000, by buying up companies in small but important local telephone markets across the United States.
"We are looking at acquisitions of this type every day," Ronald Spears vice president for Citizens' telecom sector told Reuters in an interview.
