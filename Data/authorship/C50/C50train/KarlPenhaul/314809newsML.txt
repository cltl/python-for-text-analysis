Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria on Thursday criticised the United States for its policy of rewarding or punishing countries based on their measures to fight drug trafficking.
During a visit to Colombia, Gurria said the so-called certification process was a barrier to cooperation in the war on drugs and renewed calls for scrapping the system, saying decisions were often based on ulterior motives.
"The process of certification inhibits cooperation and puts the country under scrutiny in a very difficult position. I believe there are much better ways of promoting cooperation," Gurria said at a news conference. He added that "the decision is often based on criteria other than those that one would rationally take into consideration."
Last year, Colombia was struck off the United States' list of allies in the drug war. Mexico came under severe criticism but managed to get certification and escape sanctions.
Mexico has since set up a ministerial contact group to address the issue with Washington, and that has led to an improved climate between the two governments, Gurria said.
Colombia has continued to come under heavy criticism from the United States for its perceived failure to crack down hard enough on drug trafficking.
Politicians and political analysts were divided on whether Colombia would regain certification this March in the wake of of a new law to strip drug kingpins of narcotics profits.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 80 percent of the world's cocaine is supplied by Colombia while more than half that on the streets of U.S. cities has been transported through Mexico.
