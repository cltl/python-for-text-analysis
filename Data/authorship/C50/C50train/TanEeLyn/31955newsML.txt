China's Zhenhai Refining &amp; Chemical Co Ltd, whose stock price has been lashed by the U.S. missile attacks on Iraq, said investors had over-reacted and assured it was able to overcome present difficulties.
"I would call the reaction in (the stock market in) Hong Kong merely psychological...there is minimal real impact, and if crude prices are high now we just would not buy," said a senior manager in Ningbo, eastern Zhejiang province, by telephone.
The Chinese oil refiner's share price in Hong Kong crashed almost 10 percent to HK$2.05 intraday on Tuesday before closing at HK$2.075, down 20 cents on investor fears that the refinery would be hit badly by the sharp hike in crude oil prices.
It regained only partway on Wednesday to close at HK$2.175.
After the first U.S. missile attack on Tuesday, oil prices hit their highest level since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, and investors feared Zhenhai - which runs predominantly on imported crudes and sells most of its output into China's domestic markets where product prices are strictly fixed - would be hit.  
But the eight-million tonne per year refiner, which had stopped buying crude oil cargoes since the start of the Iraqi crisis on Monday, said its crude stock-pile would help tide over high prices, at least in the short term.
"It's very hard to say how prices will go, but for now, we have our two months worth of crude stock-pile," he said.
The refiner, China's third largest, imports up to 55 percent of its crude needs from overseas, and covers 25 percent from China's offshore production.
Twenty percent is supplied from China's highly subsidised domestic onshore production, the manager said.
While 30 percent of Zhenhai's output is sold into international markets, the volume would be increased should high crude oil prices persist, he said.
"There is no limit on how much we can export, so we can push it up to cover our higher costs," he said.
