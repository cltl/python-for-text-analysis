    "# Chapter 9 - Looping over containers\n",
    "So far, you have been introduced to **integers** (e.g. 1) **strings** (e.g. 'hello'), **lists** (e.g. [1, 'a', 3] , and **sets** (e.g. {1, 2, 'Python'}). You have learned how to create and inspect them using methods and built-in functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you'll find that, most of the time, you just want to carry out some operation for all the items in a sequence. Built-in functions and methods are then not always the answer. However, the **for-loop** is!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this chapter is to introduce you to the **for-loop**, which is the most commonly used loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "**At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:**\n",
    "* loop over a list\n",
    "* loop over a set\n",
    "* loop over a string\n",
    "* work with a new data structure: tuples\n",
    "* use two slightly more advanced concepts:\n",
    "    * break\n",
    "    * continue\n",
    "    \n",

    "* The Python interpreter starts by checking whether there's anything to iterate over. If the list is empty, it just passes over the for-loop and does nothing.\n",
    "* Then, the first value in the iterable (in this case a list) gets assigned to the variable **number**.\n",
    "* Following this, we enter a **for-loop context**, indicated by the indentation (four spaces preceding the print function). This **for-loop context** can be as big as you want. All Python cares about is those four spaces. Everything that is indented is part of the **for-loop context**.\n",
    "* Then, Python carries out all the operations in the **for-loop context**. In this case, this is just **print(number)**. Because number refers to the first element of the list, it prints 1.\n",
    "* Once all operations in the **for-loop context** have been carried out, the interpreter checks if there are any more elements in the list. If so, the next value (in this case 2) gets assigned to the variable **number**.\n",
