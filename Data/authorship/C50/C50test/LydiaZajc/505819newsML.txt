Toronto's key stock index ended softer in light trading on Monday, depressed by weak gold shares and fears of a Canadian interest rate hike.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index eased 4.31 points to close at 5679.33, down more than 10 percent since its life-time high of 6348.02 on March 11.
Turnover was thin with 63.6 million shares changing hands worth C$965.6 million ($689.7 million).

Canada's dollar closed at C$1.3994 (US$0.7145) on Monday after the central bank intervened to support the sagging unit.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recouped some of Friday's 148-point loss, rising 60.21 points to close at 6451.90 on Monday.
Fears of rising U.S. interest rates, which dragged North American markets lower last week, appear to have subsided, Best said.
"Has it run its course? I would say largely," he said.
Other stock analysts suggested the threat of higher U.S. rates is not over and they predicted the correction would resume.
