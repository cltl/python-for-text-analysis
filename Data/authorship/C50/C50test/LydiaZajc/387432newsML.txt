Toronto stocks rolled to another record close on Wednesday, buoyed by firmer gold and base metal prices.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index rose 10.64 points to close at 6248.86, the 10th record close of 1997. It also set a new intra-day high of 6260.73 points.
Trading was heavy with volume of 128.5 million shares worth C$1.97 billion ($1.44 billion).
"A lot of that comes from the golds," said Dunnery Best, Midland Walwyn's director of private client investment. "All the golds across the border are looking stronger," he said.
Toronto's heavyweight gold group added over one percent while the base metal sector rose nearly two percent.
They led gains in nine of 14 sub-indices. The weak side was led by oils, transportation and banks.
"The base metals did a good job," Best added, noting that mining stocks improved as base metal prices strengthened on declining supply.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines 561 to 448 with 282 stocks unchanged.
