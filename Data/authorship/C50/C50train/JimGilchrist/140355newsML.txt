Cathay Pacific Airways is to add a fourth daily flight between Hong Kong and the Philippines because of increasing demand, a company spokeswoman has told Reuters.
The increase comes three weeks after the Hong Kong government announced the successful conclusion of six years of negotiations with the Philippines over a new Air Services Agreement (ASA).
The Confidential Memorandum of Understanding reached did not reveal how many more flights, and what increase in seat and cargo capacity was negotiated but industry sources said it is around 15 per cent. The Government described the route as one of the busiest and fastest growing in Asia.
From October 27, the Airbus A340 flight will leave Hong Kong at 7.50 AM local time and return at 10.50 AM local , Cathay says.
"There is an increasing amount of traffic between Hong Kong and the Philippines and this extra flight has very good convenient connectinns with flights out of Hong Kong to the USA and Canada," a Cathay spokeswoman said.
Filipino flag carrier Philippine Airlines already offers four flights per day from Hong Kong. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+44 171 542-5017
