A computer scientist barred from exporting a floppy disk containing computer encryption programming asked a federal court Friday to strike down the export limits as a violation of his right to free speech.
Philip Karn challenged the rules after the State Department in 1994 denied his request to export the programming on disk but allowed him to export the identical material contained in a book.
U.S. law treats many kinds of encryption, computer coding and decoding programs, under the same category as munitions.  
The Clinton administration recently issued new rules relaxing the export limits, but most existing encryption programs remain classified as munitions and are subject to strict export limits.
The limits infringed on Karn's constitutional rights to free speech and due process, his attorney, Kenneth Bass, told a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Friday.
The First Amendment of the Constitution ought to apply equally to computer code written in a book or saved in text form on a floppy disk, Bass argued.  
"It just cannot be that the Constitution doesn't recognize progress," Bass said.
Karn did not attempt to export "object" computer code, a working program that could be run on a computer to encrypt and decrypt data. Karn's disk contained "source" code, or directions that could be used to write such software.
In another case, Federal district court Judge Marilyn Patel held last month that source code should be considered a protected form of speech. But the ruling, in the Northern District of California, is not binding on the D.C. Appeals court.
