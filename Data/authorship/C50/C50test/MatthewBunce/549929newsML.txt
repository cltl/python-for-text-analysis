Cocoa bean exports from Ivory Coast jumped to 171,104 tonnes in March, against 148,827 in February and 169,065 in March 1996, official shipping data show.
March exports and bean quality were similar to last year's levels even though the 1996/97 crop is expected by pod counters to fall short of last year's 1.2 million tonne record, exporters said.
"Last year there was a demand peak earlier in the year but this year demand came later," said one shipper. "March (1997) has been one of the biggest shipment months ever so we are looking hard at the (export) figures."
Abidjan handled 119,123 tonnes of March 1997 exports with a further 51,981 tonnes leaving via the second port of San Pedro.
Cumulative exports for the first six months of 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) totalled 767,337 tonnes, against 722,646 by the end of March in 1995/96.
"The average bean count so far has been 101 (beans per 100 grams) so quality has been very good," said the exporter, adding that bean sizes last week averaged 100/100 grams.
Ivory Coast's bean export standard is 105 beans per 100 grams with less than eight percent humidity.
Some upcountry buyers have pointed to slipping bean sizes ahead of the mid-crop (May-Sept).
The main destinations for March exports from Abidjan were broadly the same as last year. North-west European ports received 85,198 tonnes, with 60,812 for Amsterdam. U.S. east coast ports took 17,161, including 13,865 for New York.
Separate figures by destination for San Pedro were not immediately available.
Shipments from the two ports during the main January and March cocoa contract months totalled 166,268 tonnes and 171,104 tonnes, against 174,927 and 169,065 last year.
Some shipments loaded in late February 1997 had probably been recorded as March exports, said one shipper.
"The (export) figure is very high for one month but bulk shipments might have put the volume up," he added.
Ivory Coast produced a crop of 1.2 million tonnes in 1995/96 and private forecasts for 1996/97 range up to at least 1.15 million tonnes.
Port arrivals stood at around 982,000 tonnes by mid-April as the main crop (Oct-April) tailed off, compared with 1.03 million tonnes in 1995/96, industry sources said this week.
Analysts have made preliminary harvest estimates of up to 180,000 tonnes for the mid-crop (May-Sept), but steady rains needed into June will partly determine final volumes.
Ivory Coast has not revised its 1996/97 total crop forecast of 950,000 tonnes, but U.K.-based broker GNI cut on Wednesday set its full year 1996/97 Ivory Coast cocoa crop estimate at 1.15 million tonnes.
GNI sharply cut its estimate of this year's world cocoa supply deficit from 180,000 tonnes to 33,000.
