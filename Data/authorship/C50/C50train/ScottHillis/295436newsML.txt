A lone Russian with a European record-breaking performance kept the Chinese women's swimming team from a clean sweep on the final day of the World Cup short-course series on Thursday.
The Chinese women struck gold by powering their way to eight victories in nine events, failing to capture only the 100 metres backstroke.
Nina Zhyvanevskaya of Russia took the crown in that event when she smashed the European record by a full 1.0 second with her time of 59.01 seconds.
In the other heats it was China all the way.
Wang Luna led Olympic gold medallist Claudia Poll throughout the 400 metres freestyle and not even a mid-contest surge by the powerful Costa Rican could propel her ahead of Wang, who clinched the win with a time of 4:05.45.
Rising star Chen Yan, who took home two golds in Wednesday's finals, emerged victorious in the 400 metres individual medley.
The 17-year-old also took silver in the 100 metres individual medley and bronze in the 100 metres backstroke.
Han Xie drew wild cheers from the crowd as she came within a hair's breadth of breaking the world record in the 50 metres breaststroke, clocking 31.00 seconds, just 0.02 second outside the record books.

Shan Ying glided to gold in the 100 metres freestyle, Qu Yun seized the title in the 200 metres butterfly and Mi Tong won the 200 metres breaststroke.
The women's gold haul was rounded out by Sun Guiling's victory in the 100 metres individual medley and Cai Huijue's 50 metres butterfly triumph.
