Toronto stocks sank to their lowest level in four months on Friday after unexpectedly high U.S. producer price data heightened fears of further U.S. interest rate hikes.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index plunged 106.47 points, or 1.84 percent, to end at 5683.64.
Nearly 88 million shares changed hands worth C$1.23 billion ($879 million).
"People are finally doing a bit of panicking here," said Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels.
The key index closed at its lowest point since December 6 when it dipped to 5672.21 points.
U.S. producer prices slipped 0.1 percent in March, but the core rate, which excludes food and energy prices, jumped 0.4 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an average increase of 0.1 percent in the core rate.
The data sparked fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates at a meeting in May, analysts said. Bank of Canada officials suggested on Thursday that the central bank was in no hurry to match the Fed's last rate hike in March.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices lost ground, led by golds, banks, media, consumer products and oils.
The key financial services group sank nearly 2.8 percent amid worries that higher interest rates would hurt profits.
