General Motors Corp. said Tuesday its fourth quarter earnings fell by more than half as labour strife slashed production and took a $700 million bite out of profits.
The world's largest automaker earned $786 million, or 92 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $1.6 billion, or $1.95 a share, in the 1995 fourth quarter. All figures exclude results from Electronic Data Systems Corp., which was spun off last June.
GM's fourth quarter revenues fell to $40.95 billion from $41.35 billion.
For all of 1996, GM earned $4.95 billion, or $6.06 a share, down from $6.03 billion, or $7.14 a share. Revenues for the year rose to $164.1 billion from $160.3 billion.
U.S. and Canadian auto workers struck GM plants in October and November, while a United Auto Workers strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants crippled GM's North American production for more than two weeks.
The strikes cut GM's full-year earnings by $1.2 billion and were largely responsible for a fourth quarter loss of $124 million in GM's core North American automotive operations. A year earlier, GM earned $603 million in North America.
"Clearly our 1996 fourth-quarter and calendar-year results were impacted by the strike-related production losses in the United States and Canada and are not indicative of GM's potential for continued profit improvement," GM Chairman John Smith said.
Smith also blamed GM's disappointing 1996 results on factory changeovers for new models and higher expenses for incentives and advertising.
GM's fourth quarter also included several extraordinary items that brought down earnings by $762 million, or 99 cents a share, including the $700 million in strike costs, a $157 million loss on the sale of four parts plants a $167 million charge related to GM's new UAW contract.
In addition, the fourth quarter also included a separate, favourable tax gain of $262 million.
The strikes also ate into 1996 profit-sharing checks for GM's union workers. GM said U.S. 282,000 represented workers in the United States will receive about $300 each -- less than half of the $800 they recived last year and a pittance of the $7,900 that Chrysler Corp. workers will get this year.
GM said 76,000 eligible salaried workers also will receive 1996 profit-sharing checks based on their level of pay and responsibility.
GM Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Losh promised that the 15 new car and truck models that GM is now introducing would bring long-awaited gains in North American market share and profitability in 1997.
GM's U.S. car and truck market share fell to 31 percent in 1996 from 32.4 in 1995.
"As we look forward to 1997, GM will get the bulk of its improvements here in North America, and we do expect to improve year-to-year," Losh told reporters.
The automaker will need the gains to offset a worsening picture in its international operations. GM officials told analysts not to expect increases in international profits for 1997 because of the slumping car market in Europe and spending for new plants in Poland, Argentina, Thailand and China.
GM's fourth quarter international profits fell to $353 million from $498 million a year ago. For the 1996 full year, they fell to $1.5 billion from $1.6 billion in 1995.
In Europe, GM's fourth quarter profits fell 60 percent to $99 million as retail incentive soared to $580 per car from $326 a year earlier.
GM's worldwide wholesale vehicle sales fell 7.1 percent to 1.99 million cars and trucks, with North American shipments off 11.4 percent and international shipments up 0.5 percent.
Analysts said the results were disappointing, but contained a few bright spots, including an increase in GM's year-end cash reserve to $17 billion from $10.2 billion at the end of 1995 and $14.5 billion on September 30, 1996.
"It's a good news, bad news quarter," said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy. "It suggests that if 1997 is normal and largely free of strikes, it ought to be another good year for cash generation."
Cash beyond GM's $13 billion reserve goal may be used to boost stock repurchases, analysts said. Losh said GM wanted to move quickly on the $2.5 billion buyback plan announced Monday. GM stock closed down $1.125 at $60.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
