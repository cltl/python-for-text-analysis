Ivory Coast is set for a bumper 1996/97 (October-September) coffee crop because of favourable weather and better farm maintenance but buyers point to quality problems, industry and port sources said on Wednesday.
With five months of the 1996/97 season remaining, exporters and crop analysts expect a total crop of up to 300,000 tonnes, against 180,000 tonnes last year and Ivory Coast's official forecast of 230,000 tonnes.
Port arrivals by April 17 totalled 228,000 tonnes compared with 150,000 tonnes by the same time last year, suggesting a return to pre-1990s levels.
Exporters said markets would be found for the increased supply of poor grades. But one quality inspector said it was unlikely the full 1996/97 crop would be shipped because of wastage and rejection.
Precise warehouse stocks were not known but the latest export and arrivals figures suggested stocks of well over 150,000 tonnes, after allowing for offtake by local roasters.
"There's still more coffee upcountry but it is coming down slowly," one upcountry buyer told Reuters. "Farmers are holding back because buyers have been offering such low prices."
Coffee marketing started slowly after the season opened later than usual in mid-November. A fall in world prices in December, stricter bank lending policies for export financing, and poor quality slowed movement of the crop from farms to ports.
Ivory Coast set a farmgate price of 695 CFA ($1.20) a kg for 1995/96 but slashed the rate as world prices dropped in late 1996, leaving the Caistab state marketing board with a large paper loss after domestic price-stabilisation payments to exporters.
Quality problems this year have meant buyers offered farmers as little as 300 CFA per kg compared to the Caistab's guideline price of 500 CFA. But one industry buyer paid over 500 CFA for premium quality beans.
"Farmers harvested the coffee in October but no-one started buying until a couple of months ago," said one crop analyst. "Coffee is usually harvested in January (after cocoa) so there was a long storage period and the beans turned black."
The output rise was caused by mild weather in the January-March 1996 flowering period. That was boosted by a peak in the general three-year cycle which sees trees yielding a weak, then moderate and finally strong crop.
"Prices were better in 1995/96 so farmers took more care over pruning trees...and general maintenance," one analyst said. "That is paying off this year as tree yields have gone up."
The manager of one plantation said better maintenance meant some farms were yielding 600 kg a hectare, compared to 450 last year.
Arrivals are running far ahead of 1996/97 exports which reached a cumulative total of 45,783 tonnes by end-March, compared to 58,667 tonnes from a smaller crop by the same date in 1995/96.
Exporters have built up stores which need sorting and regrading.
"The season will be twice as long as usual," one buyer in the productive northwestern district around Man told Reuters in January -- when coffee marketing usually starts.
Rains in December hampered drying of beans. Farmers had also harvested a mixture of ripe and unripe cherries and had not separated them before sale, buyers said.
Upcountry stores visited by Reuters in mid-April had small stocks of coffee awaiting grading or regrading. Some coffee had been stored loose because of a shortage of jute bags supplied by exporters.
Ivory Coast aims to boost exports to the level of 300,000 tonnes per year seen before the early 1990s when a drop in world prices discouraged maintenance of trees by farmers.
Buyers and crop analysts said plans to rehabilitate plantations, funded by donors, had yet to have any noticeable effect.
"They may be talking about it, but no farmers I have met have received any payments," said one crop analyst.
