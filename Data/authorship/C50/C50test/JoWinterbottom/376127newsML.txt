Tesco Plc became the latest British supermarket chain to put banking on its shopping list Thursday with plans for a venture with Royal Bank of Scotland.
Tesco said it will form the 50-50 joint venture in financial services with Royal Bank of Scotland, which will take over Tesco's interest-paying ClubCard Plus account for shoppers and launch a credit card as a first move over the summer.
Tesco expects the two companies to invest around 40 million British pounds ($65 million) during the first year in the venture.
Analysts said the move may help lessen rampant price-cutting by supermarkets competing for customers.
"With more supermarkets investing in financial services, there is less likelihood of a price war," said one industry analyst who asked not to be identified.
The new venture will most likely post a small loss in its first year but should turn a profit in the second or third year, marketing director Tim Mason said.
Mason said Tesco hoped to see similar profits eventually to those gained by retailer Marks &amp; Spencer from its financial services, which have been running for 15 years and brought in about 61 million pounds ($99 million) last year.
"If we didn't feel we could do that sort of level medium term, then we would not be as interested as we are," Mason said.
Tesco, which eclipsed J. Sainsbury as market leader in late 1995, becomes the third of Britain's four big supermarket chains to enter financial services.
Sainsbury, which was forced to launch its own "frequent shopper" card last year after the success of ClubCard, surprised the market by becoming the first of the big four supermarkets to plunge into banking when it announced plans for Sainsbury's Bank last year.
Sainsbury holds 55 percent in the bank while partner Bank of Scotland has 45 percent.
Safeway , the third largest grocery group, teamed up with Abbey National bank in November to launch banking services through its ABC loyalty card.
