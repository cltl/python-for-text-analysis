Australian paper and packaging group Amcor Ltd on Thursday reported a big fall in half-year profit and said higher paper prices and fatter margins were still over six months away.
Amcor announced a 34 percent slide in net profit before abnormal items to A$140.6 million for the six months to December 31, a little below the average market forecast of A$145 million and accompanied by a dour outlook for the rest of 1996/97.
Amcor blamed the fall on a steep fall in paper prices since they hit historic highs in the same six months of 1995/96.  
A squeeze on margins from customers in the packaging businesses also dragged earnings down, despite an overall rise in production volumes, it added.
"It just kind of limped along," Amcor managing director Don Macfarlane said of the half-year trading conditions.
So did the company's share price, which closed 14 cents lower at A$8.35 on Thursday, reflecting what brokers said was Amcor's bearish comments about the rest of 1996/97 to June 30.
