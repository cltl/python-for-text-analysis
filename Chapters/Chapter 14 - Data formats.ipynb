    "# Chapter 14: Data formats: CSV/TSV and JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look into data formats in Python. You probably have heard of (or are already quite familiar with) different data formats, such as plain text, tables (CSV/TSV), XML, JSON and RDF. These formats are simply the result of agreements that were made between people on how to organize and store data. Some of these formats, such as XML and RDF, have a high degree of structure, whereas plain text is a typical example of unstructured data. Structuring data according to predefined specifications allows information in the data to be easily ordered and processed by machines. You can compare highly structured data with a perfectly organized filing cabinet where everything is identified, labeled and easy to access. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces two commonly used formats: CSV/TSV and JSON, and explains how you can work with files in these formats stored locally on your computer. \n",
    "In the next topic, we will cover another two formats: XML and CoNLL, but more about that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "* understand two key data formats in Python\n",
    "* manipulate tabular (CSV/TSV) data\n",
    "* read and write JSON dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you want to learn more about these topics, you might find the following links useful:\n",

    "The <span style=\"background-color:yellow\">table</span> is probably one of the most common and intuitive data formats. A table represents a set of data points as a series of rows, with a column for each of the data points' properties. Tabular data can be encoded as <span style=\"background-color:yellow\">CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values)</span>. CSV and TSV files are simply plain text files in which each line represents a row and, within each line, a comma (for CSV) or a tab character (for TSV) separates the cells in the row (the columns).\n",

If you'd like, you can open these files in a text editor or Excel (convert text to columns by using the comma as delimiter) to see their content. We will show you how you can read these files in Python without using external modules.\n",
