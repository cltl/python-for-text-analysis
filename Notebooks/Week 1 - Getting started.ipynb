    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means that it treats every piece of data like some kind of object that can be manipulated and passed around. Python has the following basic *types* of objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **String**: for representing text.\n",
    "* **Integer**: for representing whole numbers.\n",
    "* **Float**: for representing numbers with decimals.\n",
    "* **Tuple**: for representing immutable combinations of values.\n",
    "* **List**: for representing ordered sequences of objects.\n",
    "* **Set**: for representing unordered sets of objects.\n",
    "* **Dictionary**: to represent mappings between objects.\n",
    "* ..and **functions**: to manipulate objects, or to produce new objects given some input.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also read about the types in Python in the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html). Basically, what you need to know now is that each type has particular *affordances*, or associated things that you can do with them. When something is of a numeric type (integer, float), the Python interpreter knows that you can perform mathematical operations with that object. You cannot use those operations with strings, because it doesn't make sense to take the square root of the string \"Hello, world!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the same with vehicles and food in real life. Anything that is of the type *vehicle* can be used to get around and possibly transport goods. But you cannot eat a vehicle. Anything that is of the type *food* is edible, but it's pretty difficult to use food for transportation. (Try biking home on a carrot.)\n",
