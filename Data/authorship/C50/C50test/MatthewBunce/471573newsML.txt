A week of prolonged and heavy rains in Ivory Coast's cocoa belt has boosted prospects for a large mid-crop (May-Sept), but more rain is needed, up-country buyers and crop analysts said on Thursday.
"We have had heavy rains of five or six hours a day for the past week so that is very good," said a leading agent working in central areas around Gagnoa and Daloa.
Crop analysts said rains favoured late mid-crop pod setting and overall bean sizes after drought from mid-January to late February threatened harvest volumes.
"It is an excellent development as March has been a bit dry, but now we would normally expect these rains to steadily increase to a June peak," said one analyst.
Analysts are waiting until April to put a figure on the mid-crop. Early estimates put the current tree crop at more than 100,000 tonnes, with over 150,000 possible if rains remain favourable.
Ivory Coast set a record 1.2 million tonnes cocoa crop in 1995/96 after an unexpected 200,000 tonne mid-crop.
Main crop (Oct-April) harvests totalled 920,000-960,000 tonnes in early March but private forecasters' early assessments predict a total crop of up to 1.1 million tonnes.
"From what I have seen the trees appear to be in good condition, although I have not visited all areas," said the crop analyst. "The effects of these rains will not be seen until some time in April," he added.
Latest national weather data for the second 10 days of March were not immediately available.
Heavy rains have fallen in the commercial capital, Abidjan, over the past week and buyers in other areas have reported regular rainfall.
"Bush tracks are getting bad, but there will be very little cocoa to go out and collect until May," said one industry source.
A crop analyst said widespread rains had also fallen on cocoa areas in neighbouring Ghana.
