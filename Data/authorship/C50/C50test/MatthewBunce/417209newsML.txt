African coffee ministers meet on Thursday to discuss cutting robusta exports following a January agreement among world producers, but some officials say disease and drought make cuts unnecessary in some countries.
African producers agreed after a January meeting of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries to cut robusta exports by a total of 850,000 60-kilo bags between January and June 1997 in an attempt to force up prices.
Individual country quotas were left to be decided later.
"We shall be looking into the export programme in light of the Rio (de Janeiro) agreement and our objective is to ensure a transparent and effective implementation," said a spokesman for the Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO).
"The ministers will take a decision on how to allocate the share which falls on Africa and how to deal with shortfalls," said IACO chief economist Donald Kaberuka. "We will also discuss the issue of non-member countries."
Eight countries will take part in the talks -- Uganda, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Kenya, Zaire, Tanzania, Madagascar and Ethiopia.
Quotas for individual countries set at the meeting would not be made public.
"Some people have said we will not make any cuts but that is not true," said Kaberuka.
A Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) official said this week that drought and disease had cut into that country's exports, making quotas unnecessary.
Uganda is Africa's largest robusta producer.
It produced around 4,644,397 60-kilo bags in 1996 against 3,079,261 in 1995, according to IACO. Ivory Coast produced 2,526,198 and 2,493,754 over the same periods.
Analysts in Ivory Coast say bean quality problems could mean no more than 130,000-150,000 tonnes will be exported in 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) despite an official forecast of 230,000 tonnes.
Ivorian exports by the end of January totalled little more than 24,000 tonnes. The season opened on November 14.
The Coffee Board of Kenya, also citing drought and disease, has forecast a drop in production and earnings this year.
Zaire's production has been cut by the conflict there since late 1996.
