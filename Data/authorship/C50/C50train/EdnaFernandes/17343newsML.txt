Millennium Chemicals - the Hanson Plc company which is due to be floated off in New York on October 1 - said on Tuesday it planned a share buyback by the year 2000 after completing debt cutting and investment plans.
Millennium chairman and chief executive William Landuyt told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that he also planned a low-yielding dividend policy as he saw the company as a growth stock.  
Millennium net debt levels are seen around $2.0 billion. Landuyt said the chemcials company would initiate a buyback by 2000 after reducing debt, implementing its capital expenditure plans and using proceeds from its steady cash generation.
Investment plans include continued expansion in the speciality products and regions including Asia-Pacific and Western Australia.
On dividend policy, Landuyt said the payout would not be high bearing in mind the need for investment and cutting debt. "Our payout will be around 60 cents a year or 15 cents a quarter."  
"We are not a dividend yield stock. We are a growth company," he concluded.
On trading, Landuyt said he expected SCM to be able to make its October price increases stick after heavy destocking by customers.
Quantum's recently reported improvement in pricing and demand also continues, he said.
He added that the recent plant closure at SCM would have a neutral trading profit impact because the plants were not profitable and had been replaced by new more efficient plant capacity.  
The closure had already resulted in $60 million of charges to write-off fixed assets, he said. But he revealed that a further $15 million charge still has to be levied.
