Virgin Group's cargo unit in Hong Kong thinks it will move significant amounts of air freight from the territory to South Africa via its new service to Johannesburg from London.
"We think there is a big market out there which is rising and that we can compete effectively via London," said Brinkley Chan, Assistant Manager for Dyna Trans (Hong Kong) Limited, Virgin Atlantic Cargo's Hong Kong agent.
Chan told Reuters that Virgin is offering a dedicated LD-3 container for South African bound cargo on its daily flights from Hong Kong to London.
He said Virgin's new, three times a week service to Johannesburg from London which began on October 2 can do well despite being a "second class carrier."
Virgin will begin flying a new shorter route to London from Hong Kong overflying China on October 27 which will permit it to carry an extra six tonnes of freight westbound.
Direct services to South Africa from Hong Kong are flown by Cathay Pacific and South African Airways.
Chan says other airlines offering indirect competition on the route include Singapore International Airlines in Singapore, Brazil's Varig via Bangkok, Gulf Air via Abu Dhabi and Emirates Airline via Dubai.
Chan said the main ex Hong Kong exports bound for South Africa will be electronics, clothing and general freight. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+44 171 542-5017
