Australian financial services group Colonial Ltd on Thursday reported a bottom-line loss of A$38 million for calendar 1996 after booking A$158 million in abnormal items after tax.
The result, down from a post-abnormal net profit of A$24 million in 1995, was hit by major "one-off" restructuring costs from the group's demutualisation and changes within its Colonial State Bank business, Colonial's accounts show.  
Earlier, the group announced to the stock exchange that its pre-abnornmal net profit fell 28 percent to A$120 million in 1996, partly dragged lower by weaker investment returns.
