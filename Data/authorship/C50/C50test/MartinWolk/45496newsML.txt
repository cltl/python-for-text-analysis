Advanced Technology Laboratories Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Fill said Wednesday he was comfortable with estimates the company will earn between $1.30 and $1.40 a share this year.
Fill also said in an interview that earnings of $1.85 a share for 1997, the consensus estimate of industry analysts according to I/B/E/S, are "within our reach."
The manufacturer of medical ultrasound equipment, also known as ATL, earned $0.74 a share last year.  
Fill spoke to Reuters after a presentation at a brokerage conference in New York, where he said the company was on track to achieve its goal of a 15 percent return on shareholders' equity by the end of 1998.
Fill said that after several turbulent years the medical-device industry is stabilizing, although he did not see any significant growth in the U.S. ultrasound market before 1998.  While the U.S. ultrasound market is flat and the European market is growing at a slow three to five percent a year, ATL sales are growing by about six to seven percent annually, he said.  
"So we are continuing to take market share," Fill said.
In April, ATL's ultrasound imaging product became the first medical device ever to win premarket approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in diagnosing breast cancer, Fill said.
He said he expected the agency to act in the next several weeks on its supplemental request for approval of the next-generation HDI 3000 machine.
In addition to breast cancer, Fill said the company's equipment increasingly is being used as a lower-cost alternative to magnetic resonance imaging for muscular-skelatal problems and for heart patients.
And he said the company sees promising opportunities in Asia and Latin America, where industry growth rates are in the "low double digits."
He said a venture with Japan's Hitachi Medical Corp aimed at penetrating the Japanese market probably will begin producing significant results beginning next year.
