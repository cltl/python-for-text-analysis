Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday that its profit jumped 82 percent to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as it rebounded from product launches that held profits down a year earlier.
Ford, the last of the Big Three Detroit automakers to report fourth-quarter results, said it earned $1 a share. The results included a $132 million charge for one-time items.
A year earlier, Ford earned $660 million, or 49 cents a share. For all of 1996, Ford's net income rose 7 percent to $4.45 billion, or $3.64 a share.
Fourth-quarter revenues were $38.8 billion vs. $34.6 billion. Revenues for the year climbed to $147.0 billion from $137.1 billion in 1995.
"We have successfully completed our highest-volume launches in North America and Europe," Ford Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Trotman said in a statement.
"We're starting 1997 in a much stronger competitive position," he said. "We expect automotive earnings to improve in 1997."
Ford's core U.S. automotive operations, which contribute about 65 percent of total automotive revenues, reported profit of $628 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $168 million a year ago.
Ford continues to benefit from strong sales of F-Series pickup trucks, Explorer sport/utility vehicles, and its new Expedition full-size sport/utility.
About 55 percent of Ford's U.S. automotive sales in 1996 were light truck products, the segment that includes pickups, minivans and sport/utilities.
But Ford continued to have problems overseas. The company's non-U.S. automotive operations lost $238 million in the quarter, up from a loss of $152 million, due primarily to losses in Europe and South America.
Ford's European loss for the quarter rose to $88 million from $48 million a year ago. But it was less than the $472 million it lost in the third quarter.
In South America, where Ford has struggled in the Brazilian market, the fourth quarter loss was $287 million, compared with $112 million a year ago.
Trotman said Ford expects better results for all of 1997 in Europe, where the company has launched several cost-cutting moves.
He also predicted improving results for Brazil and Argentina and said Ford is expecting smaller losses in South America for all of 1997, and is targeted to break even in 1998.
"We have the right plans in Brazil and Argentina to restore our strength and profitabilty, although we know it will take some time as we introduce new products, build a new organization and restore the dealer body," he said. "Overall, we are on track."
Ford's stock lost 25 cents to $32.25 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
