The Czech government delayed payments and forced some early collections in order to allow it to claim its fourth straight budget surplus in 1996, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said on Tuesday.
Kocarnik told a news conference that it was not yet clear whether the 1996 budget balancing measures and a slowdown in forecast economic growth would require cuts in 1997 spending.
The 1996 budget showed a 419 million crown ($15.4 million) surplus on revenues of 482.797 billion crowns while expenditure totalled 482.378 billion, according to finance ministry figures which are still subject to revision.
The surplus came as a shock to many after the government said in December that it was trying to hold an expected deficit to around one billion crowns.
Kocarnik said the government took 650 million crowns in early repayment on credit to the Deposit Insurance Fund, and froze one billion crowns in infrastructure investment to help the 1996 budget.
"This investment was reallocated to the following years," he said, without elaborating.
He added that ministries were also asked to save as much as possible in December, and banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s. agreed to delay their receipt of 800 million crowns in state support on housing loans.
Both banks are partially privatised, but the state still holds major stakes in each.
Kocarnik said that final 1996 result might still show a deficit since bills will keep coming until January 15.
He noted that the 1995 budget surplus ended at a revised 7.2 billion crowns from the finance ministry's originally reported 8.6 billion crowns, after various revisions.
Kocarnik repeated his committment to keep this year's budget balanced as well.
"It is early to talk about corrections (in 1997 spending) now, we do not know the final 1996 figures yet, but if they (cuts) will be needed, I will of course propose them," he said.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the "alpha and omega" of his government, has praised the figures as a sign of the country's continued fiscal responsibility.
In the autumn, the government made across the board spending cuts to avoid a forecast 9.3 billion crown shortfall, caused by high-than-expected spending, slow repayments on credits to Russia, and lower than expected tax revenue.
The 1996 budget was originally approved as a balanced budget totalling 497.6 billion crowns, but autumn spending cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns.
Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997.
But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996.
Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep Klaus's budget record entact. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($1=27.22 Czech Crown)
