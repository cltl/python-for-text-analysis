Italy, seeking a larger role in helping to fold former East Bloc countries into NATO, believes it is better to integrate, and not isolate, fringe candidates like Slovakia and Romania, a senior Italian diplomat said.
During an official visit to Prague, Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Piero Fassino told reporters late on Wednesday that Italy, as part of its new focus he called "Italian Ostpolitik", saw four countries as primary candidates for NATO's expansion.
"The position of Italy...is that the group of countries which definitely belong to NATO is Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia," he said, but added: "There's also a possiblity that Slovakia and Romania belong to that group."
He said it was important for Slovakia and Romania to implement agreements with Hungary aimed mainly at protecting the rights of ethnic Hungarians living in both countries.
Fassio said that before the West says "no" to Slovakia and Romania it was necessary to determine carefully whether they meet NATO's standards of democracy, but he added:
"If a country is integrated then we also have the right to require it to meet standards of the organisation it has joined.
"If it's isolated we can't demand anything," he said.
Both the EU and the United States have repeatedly lambasted Slovakia's government for slow democratic reforms and adopting laws threating to political opponents and ethnic minorities saying they might delay membership into "Western structures".
Fassio said it would be more useful to put fringe countries like Slovakia into the fold where more pressure can be applied.
"It is true that Slovakia is having problems fulfilling democratic principles, but the question is, 'Do we isolate Slovakia or integrate Slovakia?'. I believe it is more useful to integrate it," he said. REUTER
