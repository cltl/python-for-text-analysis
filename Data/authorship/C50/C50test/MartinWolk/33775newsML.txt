The Japanese aerospace industry is likely to become the largest international supplier of structural parts for the planned next-generation Boeing 747 jumbo jet, officials of the manufacturer said Thursday.
Discussions between Boeing and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd are aimed at significantly expanding the role of the Japanese manufacturers in producing two planned "stretch" versions of the 747, officials of the Seattle-based company said.  
"The discussions will go on until later in the year, but it is likely the Japanese industry will end up being the largest international supplier of parts for the 747-500x and -600x," said Susan Davis, a Boeing spokeswoman.
While the three Japanese manufacturers provide structural parts for most Boeing models, they do not rank among the top 10 suppliers for the current-generation 747, another Boeing official said.  
The 500x currently being offered to airlines would hold 462 passengers in a typical three-class configuration and have a range of 10,000 miles, compared with 416 passengers and 8,400 miles for the 747-400. The 600x would hold 548 and have a range of 8,900 miles.
The three so-called Japanese "heavies" already are significant Boeing partners, building about 20 percent of the structural parts for the new 777 as well as wing components and other parts for the current 747 jumbo.  
The Japanese manufacturers likely will produce 747 wing flight-control surfaces and landing-gear doors as well as fairings that join the wings to the body.
The components under discussion are provided by outside suppliers for the current 747 model with the exception of the fairings, which are made at Boeing's plant in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the site of a recent five-week strike.
In remarks last week to a group marking a century of trade between Japan and Seattle, Boeing chief executive Phil Condit said Japan Airlines Co Ltd is the company's biggest customer for 747s, having taken delivery of 96 since 1970.
"We strongly believe that strengthening of ties between our two countries remains crucial for the future," he said.
Boeing hopes that by increasing the participation of Japanese manufacturers, the company will increase its chances of landing future orders from that country's airlines, although Davis noted that there was "no guarantee."
"They provide high-quality parts at competitive prices," she said. "If it does happen to increase sales, it increases the work here in the U.S. too."
