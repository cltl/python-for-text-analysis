London-based banking giant HSBC Holdings Plc, will on Monday announce pre-tax profits for 1996 of above 4.6 billion stg, with analysts confident the bank will continue to produce profitable growth.
In 1995, pre-tax profits were 3.672 billion and HSBC is expected to raise its dividend to around 40p per share from 32p for the previous year.
HSBC is the parent of Hongkong Bank, Hang Seng, Britain's Midland and Marine Midland in the U.S.
Analysts expect HSBC's margin in its key Hong Kong market to have come under some downside pressure in the second half after a 25 basis points improvement in the first six months.
But most expect the overall margin to have been maintained and the bank's Hong Kong mortgage business to have continued to flourish.
UK Mortgage business is also being pursued aggressively although there may have been some erosion in margin and analysts will be looking to Midland Bank for cuts in its cost income ratio.
Marine Midland has already reported, weighing in with a 34 percent increase in net income to $380 million for the year.
One item that could affect the headline profit figure for the group is the level of realised stock market gains at Hang Seng which could provide a swing of as much as 100 million stg.
Analysts do not expect any strategic changes with investment banking continuing to occupy a secondary role and HSBC refusing to be drawn into competing with the large US houses but positioning itself for growth in its Asian core.
In terms of capital, HSBC is thought unlikely to perform share repurchases and analysts expect it maintain a progressive dividend policy.
