Canadian gold producer Barrick Gold Corp., the world's second largest gold producer, said on Monday that higher production in this year's second half would boost earnings after a weak first quarter.
Toronto-based Barrick reported net income fell to $55 million or $0.15 a share in the first quarter from year earlier $72 million or $0.20 a share.
Gold production from the company's 10 producing mines in Canada, the United States and Chile fell by 88,147 ounces to 712,368 ounces in the first quarter of 1997.
"Production will be substantially higher in the second half, allowing us to achieve our production target for the year of over 3 million ounces," President John Carrington said in statement. "With this level of production, we expect 1997 earnings to be compatible to 1996 and cash flow to rise to about a half-billion dollars."
Barrick's gold production was 3,148,801 ounces last year. Its 1996 earnings were $218 million or $0.60 a share, including writedowns.
Midland Walwyn analyst Michael Jalonen said he expected Barrick to earn about $0.70 a share in 1997, in line with its 1996 results when writedowns were excluded.
"Everything looks good so far. There's no surprise (in the first-quarter results). I think everybody expected what they got," Jalonen told Reuters.
He said Barrick's production and financial performance should improve in coming quarters.
Barrick said its Goldstrike property in Nevada would post significantly higher production in the second half of 1997.
First-quarter cash operating costs rose to $196 per ounce from $179 in the same period for 1996.
For the full year, cash operating costs were estimated at at $190 per ounce, compared to $193 in 1996.
Barrick stock rose C25 cents to C$32.85 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday. It was up 25 cents to $23.50 in New York.
