Sybase Inc., trying to boost sales growth, will revamp its flagship database software product and most of its other programmes this year, Chief Executive Officer Mitchell Kertzman said Wednesday.
The lineup will include an improved version of SQL Server System 11, the company's chief database software product, by the second or third quarter and a host of development tools to let customers more easily store and retrieve information in corporate databases, Kertzman said.
In the past two years, Sybase has been struggling because of increasing competition form its traditional rivals Oracle Corp. and Informix Corp., as well as a new competitor, Microsoft Corp.
Kertzman during the past year has trimmed Sybase's product lines and cut hundreds of jobs to focus the company on its core database business.
"Our customers wanted a symphony and we were giving them a lot of jam sessions" with unrelated software product lines, Kertzman said at an investment conference.
To counter rivals and grow the company's core business, Sybase, based in Emeryville, Calif., plans to release a test version soon of an improved System 11, code-named 11G, Kertzman said.
The programme, likely to be released in the second or third quarter, will have better performance in so-called parallel systems -- a feature to take on Informix, which replaced Sybase as the No. 2 database vendor in 1996.
Sybase also will release this year a product code-named "Jaguar," a so-called transaction server that helps customers more easily retrieve data from databases, Kertzman said.
Sybase stock rose 62.5 cents to $16.625 on Nasdaq.
The technology investment conference was hosted by Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.
