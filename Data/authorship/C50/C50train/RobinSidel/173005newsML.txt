Less than six weeks after the collpase of his deal to buy security firm ADT Ltd, Wayne Huizenga on Thursday shifted gears to rental cars.
The founder of Blockbuster Entertainment and owner of the Florida Marlins baseball team announced earlier that his Republic Industries Inc had signed a definitive pact to buy privately-held Alamo Rent-A-Car for $625 million.
The move is expected to catapult Republic's growing automotive business, which is rooted in used-car company AutoNation USA.
