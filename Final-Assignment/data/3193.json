They are little signs of tenderness, affection and compassion.\" \n\nAt the conclusion of his Mass, Francis made one small personal request.\u00a0\u201cI ask you to pray for me,\" Francis said.\u00a0\"Don\u2019t forget!\u201d \n\nOrganizers said the Mass, which Francis celebrated a stone's throw away from the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art made famous in the movie Rocky ,\u00a0was\u00a0expected to draw as many as 1 million participants. It\u00a0capped a busy day\u00a0for the pontiff, who spoke to victims of clergy sex abuse and vowed to\u00a0provide \"careful oversight\" to protect young believers in the future. \n\nHe also visited a correctional facility where he blessed inmates and made an unscheduled stop at a local Jesuit university. Later\u00a0Sunday evening, Francis will depart for the Vatican.\u00a0Vice President Biden is scheduled to travel to Philadelphia to bid him farewell. \n\nCatholics, as well as non-Catholics who are simply fans of \"the people's pope,\" began flooding the Benjamin Franklin Parkway early on an overcast Sunday\u00a0in hopes of landing a prime spot to bid Francis farewell. The parkway, an iconic thoroughfare, was dotted with big screens to watch\u00a0the 78-year-old pontiff deliver his final message to the American people before his return trip to Rome. \n\nBoisterous church groups banging drums and singing songs went suddenly silent as the first strains of the musical preludes of the service\u00a0wafted over the city streets.\u00a0Crowds blocks away joined in the chanting and prayers as Mass began. \n\nAutoplay \n\nShow Thumbnails \n\nShow Captions \nLast Slide Next Slide \nThe crowds were packed as far away as Philadelphia's\u00a0city hall,\u00a0more than a mile from the pope's\u00a0altar. The Mass could be heard across much of the city's downtown, where crowds stood rapt watching the celebration on the big screens. \n\n\"We are having a blessed time,\" said\u00a0Maureen Cobb, 65, a retired teacher from Canal Winchester, Ohio.\u00a0\"The weather is beautiful, the people are beautiful. All these Christians who want to celebrate the good news of Jesus Christ.\" \n\nLong lines stretched for hours ahead of the Mass, as National Guard soldiers worked to keep the surging crowds orderly. \n\nSteve Mitchell, 61, a deacon from the archdiocese in Detroit, finally gave up as the crowds\u00a0around him grew unbearably dense and stopped moving. His wife had extricated herself earlier after being jostled one\u00a0too many times. \n\nMitchell\u00a0said he wasn't\u00a0surprised by the huge numbers of people going to great effort to see the pope celebrate his last Mass in the United States.\u00a0\"It's a\u00a0historic moment,\" he said. \"This is a guy who has caught the attention of everyone. He's everyone's pope. Non-Catholics, even atheists.\" \n\nTom Delesandro, 33, a teacher from Rockledge, Pa., was on the parkway with his mother, wife and 16-month-old daughter, Ava. \n\n\"We just wanted to take all this in,\" he said with Ava in his arms. \"This is an amazing day, a once or twice in a lifetime opportunity. I'm just hoping my daughter can catch a glimpse of the pope.\" \n\nDenese Sadowski's journey to see Francis began early Sunday morning in Brandywine, Pa., but ended in disappointment in Center City\u00a0where crowds overwhelmed one of 15 security checkpoints into the papal Mass. \n\nSadowski, a business analyst, had a ticket that was supposed to give her\u00a0access to the pontiff's parade route and possibly a view of the altar where the pope would sit. But by 2 p.m., she had resigned herself to watching the service\u00a0on one of 40 giant screens\u00a0scattered through downtown. \n\n\"It's an experience. And even if I don't get in, I'm happy to be here,\" she said. \"I love him. I think he's very modernized, and I hope he'll bring more people to the Catholic Church.\" \n\nAhead of the Mass, Francis made an unscheduled stop at Saint Joseph\u2019s University to view a newly dedicated statue commemorating the 50th anniversary of Nostra Aetate, a Vatican II document that helped bolster the relationship between the Catholic and Jewish faiths. \n\nThe document highlighted the historic bond between the two faiths and dismissed past efforts by the Church to convert Jews. Saint Joseph\u2019s, a Jesuit university, established the Institute for Jewish-Catholic Relations in 1967 in response to the Vatican call for strengthening the interfaith relationship. \n\nEarlier Sunday, Francis\u00a0met privately with a group of clergy sex abuse victims.\u00a0In remarks to bishops from around the globe, Francis said \"grievous harm\" has been\u00a0caused by the clergy sex abuse scandal that has marred the church for more than a\u00a0decade.\u00a0The pontiff promised to hold those responsible for such offenses accountable. \n\n\"I remain overwhelmed with shame that men entrusted with the tender care of children violated these little ones and caused grievous harm,\" he added.\u00a0\"I am profoundly sorry. God weeps.\" \n\nThe Vatican said Francis met with five adult victims\u00a0\u2014\u00a0three women and two men\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who were abused\u00a0by clergy, family members or teachers when they were minors. \n\nIn his address to bishops, Francis focused on the difficulties of supporting the family structure in a rapidly changing world. \n\n\"Needless to say, our understanding, shaped by the interplay of ecclesial faith and the conjugal experience of sacramental grace, must not lead us to disregard the unprecedented changes taking place in contemporary society, with their social, cultural \u2013 and now juridical \u2013 effects on family bonds,\" Francis said. \"These changes affect all of us, believers and non-believers alike. Christians are not 'immune' to the changes of their times.\" \n\nFrancis also visited the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility, where he met with dozens of inmates. The pontiff offered the prisoners \u2014 who included suspected murders, rapists and mobsters \u2014 words of hope and spoke to them about forgiveness and redemption. \n\nFrancis told the inmates that scripture says\u00a0Jesus washed his apostles\u2019 feet at the Last Supper. In the past, the pope has repeated that\u00a0ritual\u00a0\u2014\u00a0washing\u00a0the feet of elderly people with disabilities as well as young people at a juvenile detention center. \n\nThe pontiff also told the the inmates that they were not alone, intoning that \"all of us have something we need to be cleansed of, or purified from.\" \n\n\"The lord goes in search of us,\u00a0to all of us he stretches out a helping hand,\" said Francis, who shook hands with each inmate and offered several blessings. \"It is painful when we see prison systems which are not concerned to care for wounds, to soothe pain, to offer new possibilities. It is painful when we see people who think that only others need to be cleansed, purified, and do not recognize that their weariness, pain and wounds are also the weariness, pain and wounds of society.\" \n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1KDp3jo \n0) { %> \n0) { %> \n\n0) { %>", "source": "Las Cruces Sun-News"}
