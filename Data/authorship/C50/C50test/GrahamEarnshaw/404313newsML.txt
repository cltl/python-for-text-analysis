One of Shanghai's top businessmen said on Wednesday that he had no doubts or concerns about policy changes following the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping last week.
"All we want is stable government," said Zhang Xuexiong whose chocolate-making company is a major supplier of confectionary to the Shanghai market and one of the city's largest private companies. "The rest we can handle with our own hands."
Zhang is the owner of the Shanghai Haolaixi Food Co Ltd, which he started in 1989 with 90,000 yuan ($10,840) in capital.
It turned a 10,000 yuan profit in the first year and he hasn't looked back since.
Last year, the company had a profit of over one million yuan, which Zhang said he expects to rise to over three million in 1997.
"(Party chief) Jiang Zemin said quite clearly in his eulogy to Deng that multiple forms of production would continue to be allowed. There will definitely be no change in policy," he said.
Zhang was effusive in his praise of Deng and his contribution to making him a millionaire.
"If the policy had not opened up, we simply wouldn't exist," he said. "Deng Xiaoping saw that it was essential to let people become prosperous before they would continue to support the rule of the Communist Party."
The company has 380 workers, but in a classic capitalist entrepreneurial move, Zhang plans to fire more than half of them later this year when he installs automatic packaging machinery imported from the United States.
Zhang, aged 45, was one of many young people shipped out of Shanghai to work in the countryside during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He returned to his native city in 1984, and started a series of small restaurants and shops.
"But private enterprise was very tough in the 1980s, especially in Shanghai. It was only after Comrade Deng's speech in 1992 opening up economic development that things got moving," he said.
