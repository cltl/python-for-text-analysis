The cause of a fire on a Malaysian Airline System Bhd Airbus A330-300 aircraft while parked at Singapore's Changi airport three weeks ago is still under investigation, a MAS spokeswoman told Reuters.
The fire started in the early hours of January 4 when the aircraft was undergoing a routine overnight check, industry sources said.
Following the fire, on January 8 Airbus Industrie said it instructed all airlines operating both the A330 and A340 jets to de-activate one of the aircraft's electrically driven hydraulic pump systems implicated in two other similar fires.
An Airbus spokesman in Hong Kong emphasised that the pump system is only used as a back-up to operate the aircraft's cargo doors and is not active in-flight.
A total of 140 aircraft -- A330s and A340s -- operated by 25 airlines are involved.
Aviation industry sources said the hydraulic pump system was first suspected when an Air France A340 was destroyed by fire, followed by another fire aboard an Air Mauritius A340 while undergoing maintenance.
The MAS spokeswoman said the airline is still assessing the extent of the damage and could give no estimate of how much it will cost to repair or how long the aircraft will be out of action.
There is no serious effect on schedules, she added. MAS operate 11 A330 aircraft on its regional network.
She addded that MAS was awaiting an accident report from Singapore's civil aviation deparment before commenting further. --Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax:5017
