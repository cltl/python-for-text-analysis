EMI, one of the world's top five music companies, said on Tuesday it expected strong sales in the current quarter to propel it to modest profit growth this year.
EMI, which has atists ranging from Sixties idols The Beatles to newcomers The Spice Girls, reported profit before tax and exceptional items fell about six percent to 293.3 million pounds ($480 million) in the nine months to December 31.
The fall would have been under one percent at constant exchange rates but the strength of sterling wiped 16 million pounds off operating profit in the period.
Finance Director Simon Duffy said that EMI still expected to meet share analysts' forecasts for full year pre-tax profit of 380-400 million pounds, excluding exceptional gains. He was confident of achieving that target despite an anticipated 25 million pound hit caused by currency factors.
EMI had 1996 pre-tax profit of 367 million pounds.
