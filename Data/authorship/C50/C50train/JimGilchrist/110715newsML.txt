Virgin Atlantic Cargo said it will begin flying a new, shorter route on its Hong Kong to London service later this month which will cut an hour off the journey time and enable an extra six tonnes of freight to be carried westbound and two tonnes eastbound.
The division of Virgin Atlantic Airways says China gave permission for the short cut after recent negotiations with the British government which also benefits British Airways Plc.
Virgin's pilots are due to begin the new northerly route via Beijing and then over Russia and Germany on October 27. The southerly track currently used is over Thailand, Bangladesh, Tashkent and Turkey.
Brinkley Chan, assistant manager for Virgin Atlantic Cargo in Hong Kong told Reuters that the new routing offers significant benefits for both passengers and cargo capacity.
"It is a much welcomed boost and will mean quite a dramatic increase in the amount of cargo we are able to carry  For the passenger it will mean one hour's less flying time," Chan said.
He said Virgin's Airbus A340 aircraft will require 50,000 pounds less fuel enabling eight tonnes of cargo to be carried with a full passenger load from Hong Kong and an extra two tonnes from London.
Until now during the winter months between November and February, Virgin has been able to carry only two tonnes of belly cargo and during the summer months four tonnes from Hong Kong. Weight penalties are less east bound, it added.
Virgin says Britain's airlines will be following in the footsteps of Germany's Lufthansa which has been flying the short cut across China for the past two years. -Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017
