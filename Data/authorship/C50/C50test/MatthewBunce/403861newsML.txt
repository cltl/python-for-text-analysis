Industry and crop analysts are sticking to forecasts of a total Ivorian 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) cocoa crop of well over one million tonnes though the government appears to say it will be less than that figure.
"We raised our forecast to 1.07 million tonnes in January from one million tonnes but really there could be 1.1 million tonnes," said one major buyer of Ivorian cocoa.
Ivorian Agriculture Minister Lambert Kouassi Konan restated on Wednesday in Paris that Ivory Coast's total 1996/97 crop would be less than one million tonnes -- in line with an earlier Ivorian Caistab marketing board estimate of 950,000 tonnes.
It was not immediately clear whether Kouassi was referring to total arrivals of cocoa at ports, or beans considered to be of sufficient quality for export.
"That would certainly not be the total arrivals figure but it could be the export figure," said one port source.
"Arrivals (of cocoa declared at ports) are already close to 900,000 tonnes (since October 1) so we are really looking at a crop of not much less than last year," said another source.
Sources close to the agriculture ministry said arrivals figures to February 21 (since October 24) stood at around 850,000 tonnes.
Quality inspectors have pointed to generally good bean quality depite humidity problems.
The 1996/97 cocoa season opened on October 24, about three weeks later than usual. Exporters have said 30,000-50,000 tonnes should be added to arrivals figures to give a cumulative arrival figure since October 1.
Crop analysts expect Ivory Coast's main crop (Oct-Sept) alone to match to the Caistab's 950,000 tonnes full-year forecast, but they said predictions of a promising mid-crop (April-Sept) were still premature.
Ivory Coast is estimated to have produced a record 1.2 million tonnes in 1995/96 after a larger than expected 200,000 tonnes mid-crop.
Prospects for this year's mid-crop depend partly on rains over the next few weeks.
Industry sources do not expect rejection of cocoa at port to reduce total exports significantly.
Industry sources said undisclosed amounts of sub-standard cocoa had been declared at ports but rejected as Fair Average Quality (FAQ) -- or unexportable sub-grade.
That would be either mixed in with better quality cocoa and exported, or bought by local factories.
Rejection of cocoa could cut into total crop figures but industry sources say little is likely to go to waste.
"Most is presented again for export. Little goes to waste so it will be sold somehow," said one exporter, referring to humidity problems in early 1997.
One set of figures circulating put arrivals to February 21 at 936,000 tonnes, with close to 150,000 tonnes initially classified as sub-grade, industry sources said.
Ivory Coast has said in the past it would process its lower quality mid-crop cocoa locally to remove lower grades from world markets and add more value to exports.
"Local factories will probably use about 160,000 tonnes this year so a certain proportion will be set aside for that," one source said.
Factory capacity currently stands at around 180,000 tonnes although plans for more factories are reaching final stages.
Foreign buyers recently voiced concern that poorer grades were being mixed in with export quality cocoa rather than being absorbed by local factories.
"The normal crop potential for Ivory Coast is around 1.17 million tonnes," said one port source. "Take off 160,000 tonnes and you are not far off the one million figure," he added.
"The question is how much will be held back for next year to speculate on prices. That depends on how much money traders have to hand," he said.
