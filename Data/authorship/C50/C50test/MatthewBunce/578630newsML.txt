Ivorian coffee exporters are busy grading a large crop and will pay little attention to next week's meeting of Association of Coffee Producing Countries, when world export plans will be reviewed, exporters said.
"Forget it. It means nothing," said one on Tuesday. "The (current retention) quantity is not shocking and we do not expect anything new but it might hit sentiment."
Green robusta coffee arrivals at Ivorian ports totalled around 250,000 tonnes by May 9 in the 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) season against just over 180,000 by the same time last year, they said.
African producers agreed in January to cut robusta exports (Jan-June) from 6.52 million (60-kg) bags to 5.67 million under an ACPC export plan but the amount to be retained by each country was unclear.
Ivory Coast agreed to subtract 15,000 tonnes from its share of a previously agreed African quota totalling 6.52 million bags (Jan-June). Its share of the existing quota was not published.
Ivorian coffee exports and local industry offtake since the start of the season were about 110,000-120,000 tonnes to date, leaving export warehouse stocks of just over that amount.
"Those stocks have nothing to do with the (ACPC) plan, said one. "That (stock) takes into account Nestle (Ivory Coast's main roaster) buying 30,000 tonnes for this year," said one source. "Jean-Abile Gal (a smaller roaster) has also bought 5,000 to 10,000 for blending with imported arabica."
Ivorian exporters expect a steady flow of shipments up to the end of the season despite roller-coaster world prices which this week hit a year high of $1,835 tonne basis July.
Robusta prices have risen 51 percent since January after late 1996 lows which prompted African countries to press the ACPC for an export limit plan to propel flagging robusta prices closer to higher Arabicas, which have doubled since January. Analysts have said the rises were more due to production fundamentals and uncertainty stemming from Just-In-time inventory policies adopted by roasters, rather than export retention.
Ivorian coffee exporters say the (Jan-June) ACPC plan was irrelevant for Ivory Coast given that coffee grading capacity only allows about 20,000 tonnes to be processed a week. That meant stocks would have built up without the plan with little chance of exceeding quotas.
Stocks might be carried into 1997/98 depending on late-season world prices, they added. However, shipments could pick up in July. U.S. analysts cited a robusta coffee supply squeeze ahead of end-season shipments for a robusta price spike basis July.
"It depends on the exporters' books," said one forwarder.
If the price trend continued, warehouses would empty out despite rising exports from non-ACPC Asian producers, said another. "Ivory Coast usually exports between 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes a year. If late-season prices are good all the coffee might leave," he said.
Arrivals totalled about 12,000 tonnes last week, said one exporter. Quantities remaining upcountry were not clear but villagers were still holding stocks back for better prices from buyers, he added.
"When prices are low up to 50,000 tonnes of coffee can be carried over between seasons. Not of all of this year's crop will necessarily be exported," he added.
Ivory Coast has produced a better-than-expected 1996/97 crop, seen reaching anything up to 300,000 tonnes by the season's end against 180,000 last year. It has forecast 230,000 tonnes for this year but arrivals totalled that amount by the end of April -- with five months of the season remaining.
