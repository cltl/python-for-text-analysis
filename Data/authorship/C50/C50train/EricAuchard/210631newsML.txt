CompuServe Corp., acknowledging its failure to attract U.S. consumers, said Thursday it would disband its family-oriented Wow! online service and focus on its business and technical customers.
The world's second-largest online service also said it would accelerate the way it expenses customer marketing costs and that it was taking a $28.6 million charge in the latest quarter for previously incurred subscriber acquisition costs.
The company said it would pursue businesses with higher profit margins, including international consumer markets, espcially those in Europe.
"For CompuServe, this represents a strategic retreat back to its basics," said Peter Krasilovsky, a veteran analyst of the online industry at Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md.
"CompuServe will never contend for the king's mantle among the online service/Internet service providers in North America again," he said.
CompuServe officials stressed no layoffs would result from the latest moves. Wow!'s 35 employees have already been absorbed into CompuServe Interactive, they said. The company's total head count stands at about 3,200 worldwide.
The company laid off 150 employees, or 4 percent of its work force, in an earlier cutback announced last summer.
CompuServe's moves come on the heels of recent aggressive actions by rival America Online Inc. to stay on top by offering a series of new pricing options, including a flat monthly rate of $19.95, and by shutting down its direct Internet access service.
Since CompuServe's parent, H&amp;R Block Inc., sold 20 percent of the online service to the public in April, CompuServe has struggled to keep up with America Online, the largest online service, and with a host of Internet-based competitors.
America Online has more than 7 million subscribers. As of Oct. 31, CompuServe said it had 3.3 million direct worldwide subscribers. NiftyServe, its Japanese licensee, had a total of 5.3 million, roughly the same level as in July.
In reaction to CompuServe's continuing troubles, H&amp;R Block in August shelved plans to spin off the 80 percent of CompuServe it still owns.
Since CompuServe's initial public stock offering in April, its prospects have dimmed, with its stock tumbling from an initial price of $30 a share. The stock fell 94 cents Thursday to $10.69 on Nasdaq.
Earlier Thursday, H&amp;R reported a substantial loss for its second quarter ended Oct. 31, citing CompuServe's turmoil.
Krasilovsky said CompuServe's plan to go back to basics was "very realistic," but added "too bad they didn't do it a year-and-a-half ago."
The analyst said he expects the company to reposition itself to provide niche services to business customers who don't want to pay for a high-level premium online service.
In a telephone interview, CompuServe spokesman Steve Conway said that while his company was abandoning further mass-marketing efforts aimed at U.S. consumers, "If you are currently a subscriber, you will not notice a change."
Nontheless, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said it would target its efforts and investments at business and professional users, its traditional strength.
Wow! was introduced seven months ago to much fanfare, but failed to get off the ground. Wow! customers numbered 102,000 at latest count, the company said.
The company blamed the failure of Wow! on new market entrants, or Internet service providers, pricing competition and the high costs of consumer marketing.
The company also said it plans to launch early next year a new "CompuServe for Business" service, an enhanced version of its core CompuServe Interactive with a new interface and added content from "thousands" of information providers.
Despite a series of missteps in the United States, growth remains robust overseas where CompuServe's brand is the best recognised name among online and Internet access providers.
In Europe, for example, CompuServe said subscribers to its main CompuServe Interactive online service had nearly doubled to more than 800,000 in the past year.
