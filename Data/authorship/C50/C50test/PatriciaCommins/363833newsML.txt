Quaker Oats Co. Thursday reported a profit for the fourth quarter, reversing a year-ago loss, but said its Snapple beverage business was unprofitable and continued to be a disappointment.
Quaker said Snapple's U.S. and Canadian sales dropped 8 percent in 1996, with volume down 11 percent. Sales of its six-flavor Diet Snapple line, however, rose 23 percent in 1996.
Chicago-based Quaker said it earned $18.1 million, or 12 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $47.8 million, or 36 cents a share, in the 1995 period. Excluding a $40.8 million pretax restructuring charge in the 1995 fourth quarter, Quaker posted a year-ago operating loss 18 cents a share.
Fourth quarter revenues were $1.06 billion, down 10 percent from $1.18 billion a year earlier, which included $90.3 million from divested businesses.
For the full year, Quaker said it earned $244 million, or $1.80 a share, which included a $113.4 million gain on divested business. In 1995, it earned $720 million, or $5.39 per share, with a $1.05 billion gain.
Sales last year were $5.20 billion, 13 percent below the previous year's $5.95 billion, which included $796.9 million from divested businesses.
"This was a rebound year in which our largest, value-driving businesses -- U.S. and Canadian foods and worldwide Gatorade -- increased their operating profits," Chairman William Smithburg said in a statement.
A $100 million cutback in advertising and marketing costs in 1996 also helped results, analysts added.
In a conference call, Smithburg said Quaker was committed to at least 10 percent real earnings growth in 1997. "We're going to try like crazy to do even better than that," he said.
Quaker management again pledged to turn around Snapple, which it bought over two years ago for $1.8 billion.
"We need to stabilize (Snapple's) volume" in 1997, Smithburg said. "Our goal is to operate Snapple at cash positive in 1997."
Cash positive means Snapple is expected to be profitable, excluding goodwill charges of about $50 million a year.
Quaker surprised some analysts by not taking a charge in the fourth quarter to reduce Snapple's value. Analysts had expected Quaker to take a large writedown for Snapple, potentially as high as $1 billion.
Smithburg declined to comment on speculation and rumors that Quaker was looking to sell Snapple, a fruit-flavored and iced tea beverage business, and its Gatorade sports drink.
He said Quaker's management continues to review steps to "create value for shareholders," but declined to be specific.
Gatorade, Quaker's largest brand, had a strong year in 1996, Smithburg said, with sales volume rising 6 percent in the fourth quarter and 4 percent year-to-date.
Gatorade is launching this year a "Frost" line of Gatorade beverages that will feature a "cooling taste," Smithburg said. "The trade acceptance has been nothing short of terrific."
Smithburg said the company's hot cereals business had a strong year, with sales volume up 9 percent.
Ready-to-eat cereals, such as Cap'n Crunch and Life, gained 3 percent in volume for 1996. The value-priced line of bagged cereals grew more than 40 percent in the year.
Quaker stock was down 62.5 cents at $35.875 in afternoon trading.
