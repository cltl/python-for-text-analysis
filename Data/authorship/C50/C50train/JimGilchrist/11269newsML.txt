United Parcel Service of America Inc (UPS) said the first aircraft to use its US$4 million Asia-Pacific hub now under construction in Taiwan will arrive on September 10, Mark Sobolewski, UPS director of engineering for Asia-Pacific told Reuters.
He added that the first phase of the hub at Taipei's Chiang Kai Shek airport is due to formally open on October 10 and is on schedule to be fully operational by March next year.
Six Boeing aircraft -- two 747s, two 757s and two 767s -- are due to operate eight flights a day in and out of Taipei six days a week from March connecting the U.S. with the company's growing Asian network.
The fast package carrier confirmed this week that it had won traffic rights to operate five frequencies a week from Bangkok. Sobolewski says other cities to be linked to the Taipei hub are Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Osaka.
"The hub will enhance our service throughout Asia, make us more competitive and as this market grows we will have a reliable product and give a superior service. We have had very positive feedback from our customers especially in Taiwan," Sobolewski told Reuters from his Singapore office.
With the six aircraft, some brand new, the total investment in Taipei will amount US$400 million, UPS said. It added construction work on the first phase of the 4,800 square metres sorting office began this month.
The first Taiwan-based aircraft due next month will activate traffic rights awarded to UPS under the recent Japan-U.S. bilateral agreement, allowing packages to be picked up at Osaka's Kansai airport for distribution throughout Asia.
