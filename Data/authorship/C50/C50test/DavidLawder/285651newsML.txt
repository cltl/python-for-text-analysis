Automakers ended a strong 1996 with a whimper Friday, as General Motors Corp. said December U.S. car and truck sales fell nearly 14 percent and Chrysler Corp. managed a 1.1 percent sales gain for the month.
Chrysler's full-year sales of 2.45 million vehicles, however, broke the company's 1988 record, and the industry stayed on track to report full-year sales of 15.1 million cars and light trucks, matching the 1994 total that was also its best year since 1988. Automakers sold about 14.8 million cars and light trucks in the United States in 1995.
"It was a pretty good year as a whole, but it's closing on a soft note," Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said.
December sales from the 14 automakers who reported Friday ran 8.6 percent below the year-ago results, but full-year sales were up 1.8 percent. Analysts predicted that the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for the month would be about 14.5 million to 14.8 million units, compared with a strong December 1995 rate of 15.9 million units.
Several Japanese automakers also reported December sales declines on Friday. Ford Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. are set to release year-end sales results on Monday.
GM's car sales fell 12.5 percent in December and normally stronger sales of GM trucks also fell a sharp 15.6 percent.
The December declines brought the auto giant's full-year 1996 vehicle sales to 4,793,169 cars and trucks, a 2.7 percent decline from the 4,895,368 units sold in 1995.
GM's sales for the year were marred by strikes that disrupted production in March, late October and early November, but analysts said car model changeovers and stiff competition in trucks also took a toll.
"I think we're past the point where you can use the strikes as an excuse," Healy said. "I think Ford and Chrysler are beginning to hurt GM in the truck area, where its products aren't fresh any more."
Still, GM said truck sales for the full year exceeded 2 million units for the first time, rising 2.8 percent over 1995.
GM marketing chief Ronald Zarrella predicted gains in both cars and trucks in 1997, fueled by new sedans, minivans and increased sport/utility vehicle producion.
"The positive reception our new-for-'97 models are receiveing from both our dealers and customers is a certain sign that the coming year will be a good one for General Motors and its dealers," Zarrella said in a statement.
GM's market share has hovered near 30 percent in recent months, continuing a steady decline over the past decade.
By contrast, Chrysler estimates that its market share increased by nearly 2 percentage points to nearly 16 percent.
Bolstered by strong sales of minivans, pickup trucks and sport/utility vehicles, Chrysler said its 1996 sales totaled 2,450,826 vehicles, up 13 percent from 1995's 2,164,343. It broke the previous annual record of 2,208,057 units, set in 1988.
Chrysler said December sales of North American-built vehicles rose 5.4 percent but light truck sales dipped 0.2 percent in the month. For the full year, Chrysler's domestic car sales rose 6.6 percent to 827,941 units while light truck sales rose 16.7 percent 1,618,193.
Chrysler's executive vice president of sales, James Holden, said Chrysler may have difficulty surpassing 1996 results this year in some months due to model changeovers. He said the industry will still need incentives to maintain its sales pace.
"I don't see a way to wean ourselves completely from rebates and incentives, but I expect to hold them to similar levels to what we've had, which have been relatively modest."
Chrysler stock rose 50 cents to $34.625 while GM fell 62.5 cents to close at $57.875, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
Among Japanese automakers, Toyota Motor Corp. said December sales fell 17.4 percent while full-year sales rose 6.4 percent to 1.16 million units.
Nissan Motor Corp.'s December sales dipped 0.2 percent and full-year sales fell 3.4 percent to 749,763 units.
Mazda Motor Corp.'s December total was off 17.2 percent while annual sales fell 16.6 percent to 238,285 units.
Germany's Volkswagen AG posted its best U.S. sales year since 1990, with sales up 17.3 percent to 135,907 cars and trucks. December sales jumped 23.5 percent.
