Toronto stocks finished one percent higher for a second consecutive session on Wednesday, fueled by investor enthusiasm following strong corporate earnings.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Index jumped 73.07 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 5976.63 after adding 68 points on Tuesday.
"It's being continually spurred on by what we're seeing come out of the cash register. Earnings really are doing very, very well on balance," said ScotiaMcLeod senior vice-president Fred Ketchen.
Trading was brisk at 95.3 million shares worth C$1.5 billion (US$1.07 billion).
"New York vastly outperformed us yesterday, so this is turnabout fair play," Ketchen said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 179 points to hit 6962 on Tuesday.
Earnings euphoria swept aside earlier inflation fears after the U.S. government released unexpectedly strong gross domestic product figures. GDP rose 5.6 percent on an annualized basis in the first quarter, compared to economists' forecasts of 4.1 percent.
Ketchen said that investors are awaiting Friday's U.S. employment numbers for more direction on inflation and whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to hike short-term interest rates.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by conlomerates, consumer products, transportation and base metals.
Gaining issues beat decliners 593 to 366, while 301 traded flat.
In individual issues, Shell Canada Ltd. soared 3.90 to 57.40. The energy company said first quarter earnings rose to C$1.35 from a year-earlier C$0.87 and that it plans to buy back 14 percent of its Class A common shares.    Conglomerate Brascan
