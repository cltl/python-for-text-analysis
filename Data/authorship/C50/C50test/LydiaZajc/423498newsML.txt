Canada's Philip Environmental Inc. said on Thursday it planned to acquire Houston-based Allwaste Inc. and Serv-Tech Inc. in two deals worth $612 million, creating North America's biggest recycling firm.
"We are naturally very, very excited about this opportunity," Philip Chief Executive Allen Fracassi told a media conference call. "It makes great economic sense and the synergies are just spectacular."
Hamilton, Ontario-based Philip said that when completed in June, the deals would create North America's largest metals recycling and industrial services company, with annual revenues topping $1.6 billion, 8,000 employees and 215 operating locations in North America, Europe and South America.
Philip, which has recently made a spate of acquisitions to expand beyond the metals recycling business, said it would swap 0.611 of a Philip share for each Allwaste share for total consideration of $540 million.
The deal included the assumption of about $133 million in debt from Allwaste, which provides industrial services.
In a separate transaction, Philip agreed to exchange 0.403 of a Philip share for each Serv-Tech share in a deal valued at $72 million, including the assumption of $21 million of debt.
Industrial and environmental services firm Serv-Tech generated more than $140 million in revenues in 1996 and Philip said its earnings would be boosted by the Serv-Tech deal.
Fracassi told reporters that Philip might make more acquisitions.
"Our acquisition programme will continue. We are in a very very quickly consolidating, fairly new industrial sector, so we'll continue to seek and react to opportunities," he said.
Analyst Peter von Ond at Canadian brokerage Midland Walwyn called the deals a good fit.
Von Ond said he revised his 1998 earnings estimate for Philip to C$1.70 ($1.25) a share from C$1.60 ($1.17). His 1997 forecast was unchanged at C$1.40 ($1.03) a share since the deals do not close until late June and more Philips shares will be issued, offsetting earnings growth.
Philip earned C71 cents (52 cents) a share in 1996.
Shares of Philip were down C50 cents to C$22 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday and by 25 cents to $16.125 in New York.
AllWaste rose $2.50 to $9.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Serv-Tech rose 81.25 cents to $5.875 on Nasdaq.
