    "## 1. Basic Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means that it treats every piece of data like some kind of object that can be manipulated and passed around. Python has the following **basic types of objects**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **String**: for representing text.\n",
    "* **Integer**: for representing whole numbers.\n",
    "* **Float**: for representing numbers with decimals.\n",
    "* **Tuple**: for representing combinations of objects.\n",
    "* **List**: for representing ordered sequences of objects.\n",
    "* **Set**: for representing unordered sets of objects.\n",
    "* **Dictionary**: to represent mappings between objects.\n",
    "* **Booleans**: too represent the truth values `True` or `False`.\n",
    "* ..and **functions**: to manipulate objects, or to produce new objects given some input.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also read about the types in Python in the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html), and we will work with each of them during the course. In this block, we will focus on **strings, integers floats and booleans**. We will also show you some other types, which will be explained in more detail in the next block. \n",
