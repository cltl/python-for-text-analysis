AT&amp;T Corp. said Thursday it set an alliance with Shaklee Corp. that will allow Shaklee's 500,000 sales agents to sell AT&amp;T residential calling plans face-to-face with customers at home.
The alliance is called Shaklee Connections and is expected to reach millions of new customers in 1997 and beyond, AT&amp;T said. No financial details were disclosed.
"Without question, this is a groundbreaking move for AT&amp;T," said Joseph Nacchio, executive vice president of AT&amp;T's consumer and small business division.
Shaklee, part of Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. of Japan, sells nutritional supplements, personal care products, household cleaners, and water treatment products.
"Shaklee will help us expand our personal presence in communities exponentially and create a whole new network of representatives with roots in neighbourhoods across the country," Nacchio said.
Shaklee's independent sales agents will be eligible to become authorised AT&amp;T distributors and will be AT&amp;T customers themselves. They will begin marketing in the first quarter of 1997.
AT&amp;T is taking a page from the books of its smaller competitors by adopting a so-called multi-level marketing campaign.
Analysts have watched with interest as a number of small resellers of consumer long-distance service, notably Excel Communications Inc., have taken a bite out of AT&amp;T's customer base by using independent sales agents to sell to customers at their homes or in other one-on-one settings.
AT&amp;T's market share in the $70 billion long-distance market has sunk to about 55 percent from 90 percent over the last decade, analysts estimated, and small, aggressive resellers like Excel are among those taking away customers.
There are 1,000 resellers of long-distance service in the United States. They do not own networks but buy wholesale capacity on networks owned by companies like AT&amp;T and WorldCom Inc.
