Czech economic growth should slow
in 1997, before accelerating again as an ailing foreign trade
balance improves, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), said on Thursday.
Czech inflation, it said, should ease a bit in 1997 and
more decisively the following year.
In its twice-yearly report, the Paris-based organisation of
the world's most industrialised countries forecast gross
domestic product (GDP) growth to slow to 4.6 percent next year
from 4.8 percent in 1996 but then rise to 5.3 percent in 1998.
"Growth is projected to become better balanced with
investment expected to continue to grow at double digit rates
and household consumption playing a smaller role in GDP
growth," the report said.
The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP would
dip to 5.4 percent in 1997 from 5.8 percent this year, but then
ease to 4.9 percent of GDP in 1998, it said.
Export growth should accelerate to 7.5 percent year-on-year
in 1997 and 8.7 percent in 1998 from 5.5 percent this year,
while import growth should slow to 9.5 percent in the next two
years from 11.3 percent.
"The foreign (trade) balance is expected to improve since
import growth will weaken while exports should recover from the
recent slowdown in line with the projected economic recovery in
the main export markets," the OECD said.
The Czech National Bank however has warned that the
country's current account deficit could grow to as much as
seven percent of gross domestic product in 1996.
The OECD said annual inflation should slow to 8.5 percent
in 1997 and 7.5 percent in 1998 from 9.1 percent this year.
As consolidation continues in the economy, unemployment
should rise to 3.6 percent next year and 4.1 percent in 1998
from about three percent this year, still one of the lowest
rates in the industrialised world.
It said "higher labour productivity and projected wage
moderation will have a favourable effect on price dynamics, but
the inflation rate will still be higher than the OECD average
by the end of the projection period."
But the OECD, which the Czechs joined at the end of 1995,
warned of risks if real wage growth fails to moderate after
growing faster than productivity over the last three years.
"The consumption boom could continue and, despite the
announced fiscal prudence, the trade deficit could widen
further," it said.
