BBI Healthcare Corp, the company to be formed by the merger of Bergen Brunswig Corp and Ivax Corp, will target earnings growth of 15 percent or more and return on equity of 15 percent or better, said Bergen chief financial officer Neil Dimick.
"At a minimum, our objective would be to grow earnings at greater than 15 percent," Dimick said at an investors conference here Tuesday held by the Raymond James brokerage and investment bank.  
The Bergen-Ivax merger is proceeding as planned, said Bergen chief executive Donald Roden.
Orange, Calif.-based Bergen is the largest U.S. distributor of generic drugs, while Miami-based Ivax is a generic drug manufacturing giant.
The two agreed in November to a stock-for-stock merger in which Ivax shareholders will get 0.42 shares of BBI for each Ivax share, and Bergen shareholders will get one share of BBI for each Bergen share. After the merger, BBI will be about 56 percent owned by Ivax shareholders and the remainder by Bergen shareholders, the companies said.  
Roden will be BBI chief executive. Ivax chief executive Phillip Frost and Bergen chief executive Robert Martini will be co-chairmen of BBI, while Dimick will be BBI chief financial officer, the companies said.
BBI will be a vertically integrated company handling generic drugs and other healthcare products from the research lab, through production and distribution, the companies said.
Bergen also announced Tuesday that it has developed an electronic, on-line catalog and historical purchasing database service for generic drugs and healthcare products. "Catalog users will have instant access to more than 300,000 products offered by any and all of our subsidiaries," Roden said.
The on-line service will make purchasing data going back 24 months available via computer, Bergen said.
The electronic catalog is scheduled to be delivered to customers in June, Bergen said.
