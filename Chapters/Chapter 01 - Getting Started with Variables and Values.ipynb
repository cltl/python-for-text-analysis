    "\n",
    "*This notebook uses code snippets and explanations from [this course](https://github.com/kadarakos/python-course/blob/master/Chapter%201%20-%20Variables.ipynb).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the course! In this course we will learn how to load, process and save data using a versatile programming language: Python. We are going to practise Python using Notebooks. These Notebooks contain instructions and so called 'code blocks'. The instructions are paragraphs of text that explain the concepts we are going to use. The 'code blocks' contain Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are pretty straightforward. Some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cells in a notebook contain code or text. If you run a cell, it will either run the code or render the text.\n",
    "* There are five ways to run a cell:\n",
    "    1. Click the 'play' button next to the 'stop' and 'refresh' button in the toolbar.\n",
    "    2. Alt + Enter runs the current cell and creates a new cell.\n",
    "    3. Ctrl + Enter runs the current cell without creating a new cell. (Cmd + Enter on a Mac.)\n",
    "    4. Shift + Enter runs the current cell and moves to the next one.\n",
    "    5. Use the menu and select Cell/Run all.\n",
    "* The instructions are written in Markdown. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a nice Markdown cheatsheet if you want to write some more.\n",
    "* Explore the menus for more options! You can even create a presentation using Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** when you're writing Python code, press Tab to auto-complete your variable names! We will explain what variable names are in further down in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "* print information to your screen using the built-in function `print()`\n",
    "* assign *values* to *variables* (using valid and clear *variable names*)\n",
    "* do calculations in Python\n",
    "* have an understanding of some basic aspects of programming in python\n",

    "#### Important information for this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We work with the latest python version (3.7). Please make sure this is the version you're using. \n",
    "- We highly recommend using the Anaconda [distribution of python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). It comes with a couple of highly useful python installations as well as the jupyter notebook environment. Everything you need will be installed in one go.\n",
    "- This course does not assume any programming background. We strongly believe that anyone can learn how to code. We encourage a playful attitude and do our best to include fear-taking exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A note on getting stuck:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please note that learning how to code is a process that usually heavily relies on 'trial and error'. This means that throughout the course, you will repeatedly have to try out different solutions until you find out what works (and hopefully why). Having to try several times is completely normal and part of the process - please do not get discouraged. \n",
    "- It is highly recommended to start learning how to 'debug' your own code early on. If you do not know what to do or get error messages, try and take a step back and think about what you were doing and why. Using pen and paper to break down problems into smaller steps is highly recommeded. We will highlight different debugging strategies throughout the course. \n",
    "- If you still feel lost after having tried to solve your problems yourself, please feel free to contact the teachers. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have **questions** about this chapter, please contact Pia (pia.sommerauer@vu.nl).\n"

In Python, the term **variable** refers to such a box, whereas the term **value** refers to what is inside this box. \n",
