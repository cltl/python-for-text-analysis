Mercantile Bancorp Inc said Monday it could still make other acquisitions while it is completing its $855 million merger with Mark Twain Bancshares Inc.
"While this will be an active project for us beginning today, it doesn't mean that we don't have additional capacity to continue," John Beirise, Mercantile's group president in charge of mergers and acquisitions, said in an interview.
Beirise noted that not all of Mercantile will be involved in the acquisition of St. Louis-based Mark Twain, so acquisitions in other geographic locations might be possible. He also said Mercantile has been an active acquirer, and so is adept at assimilating mergers.
St. Louis-based Mercantile, with $18.2 billion in assets, currently has four mergers pending.
The Mark Twain deal, announced Monday and expected to close in the second quarter of 1997, is an exchange of shares valued at $49.62 per Mark Twain share, based on Friday's closing price, the banks said.  
That works out to 2.8 times Mark Twain's book value, a price Beirise conceded was lofty for banks in general.
"In general it is, yes, but not many banks earn 1.8 (return) on assets," he said. Mark Twain reported return on average assets of 1.82 percent in the third quarter, well above average for Midwest banks.
Beirise said Mercantile was not considering its potential as a takeover target when it made the deal to acquire Mark Twain. Mercantile, the second largest bank holding company in Missouri behind Boatmen's Bancshares Inc, has been mentioned by analysts as an acquisition target for banks trying to expand their Midwest presence. Boatmen's agreed in August to be acquired by NationsBank Corp.
Beirise said as long as the bank delivered value for shareholders, it would be a difficult takeover target.
"Someone would have to make the case that we're not doing the job," Beirise said. "We think as long as we're doing the job, we are the best value for our shareholders."
