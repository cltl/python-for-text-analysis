British private client stockbroker and fund manager Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management said on Thursday it is in talks with Dutch banking giant ABN AMRO's ABN AMRO Hoare Govett which may lead to an offer for CCM.
Capel-Cure is controlled by Canadian Insurance Group and chief executive John Henderson confirmed the talks but declined to give any of the financial details of the offer.
Capel-Cure has 4.5 billion pounds under management and employs around 450 staff.
Canadian Insurance, a consortium of banks, bought its stake in Capel-Cure-- the rest is owned by the management -- when Central Capital Corp of Canada went bust in 1992. It had previously been owned by Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Corp.
Henderson said the management of Capel-Cure had been involved at every stage and denied press reports that there had been a disagreement between the Capel-Cure management and Canadian Insurance on whether the fund manager should be sold and how.
ABN AMRO is known to have wanted to expand its London operations with a fund management acquisition.
In January, Jan Vroegop, director of ABN AMRO's global asset management operation said the bank wanted to make "big steps" in the lucrative London fund management arena.
ABN AMRO Hoare Govett was involved in a controversial attempt to poach star fund manager Nicola Horlick from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in January.
Horlick was suspended and later resigned from DMG and ABN admitted that it had talked to her but denied trying to poach her entire team from DMG.
Nick Bannister, head of ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, was unavailable for comment.
