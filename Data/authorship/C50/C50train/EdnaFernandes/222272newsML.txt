Stagecoach, the British bus and rail group which has seen its share price grow fivefold in three years, Thursday posted a bumper 127 percent rise in first-half profits, boosting its stock to a record high.
The Scottish-based group, which has enjoyed explosive growth since its flotation in 1993, said half year pre-tax profits climbed to a record 47 million pounds ($79 million). The half year dividend rose 43 percent to 3 pence (5 cents) a share and group revenues leapt to 405 million pounds ($679.0 million) from 198.8 million ($333.3 million).
Chairman Brian Souter called the results excellent.
Shares in Stagecoach were up 45.5 pence (76.28 cents) at 629 ($10.54) by 1350 GMT (8:50 a.m. EST), leading a fleet of other bus companies higher in its wake. Go-Ahead Group rose 15 pence to 411.5 ($6.90) and Cowie Group added 5.5 pence (9.2 cents) to 396p ($6.63).
"It's good news all round. The profits are two million ($3.4 million) above what I expected. We're upgrading our year forecast by five million ($8.4 million) to 97 million pounds ($162.6 million)," said UBS analyst Richard Hannah.
The results were the first since the group's high profile acquisitions of British rail rolling stock company Porterbrook and the Swedish bus group Swebus.
"The integration of Porterbrook and Swebus is proceeding and I am confident of a successful outcome," said Souter.
Porterbook and the bus operations were the real driver behind the growth in profits. The figures were also flattered by a one-off gain of 15 million pounds ($25.1 million) from the sale of a 21.7 percent stake in Strathclyde Buses. This was reflected in the high half-year payout.
Porterbook's profits were better than expected at 13.5 million pounds ($22.6 million) in the six weeks since it was acquired.
"That's about two million ($3.4 million) profit a week on operating profit margins of 40 percent," said Hannah.
Stagecoach finance director Keith Cochrane said operating profits would ease slightly in the latter part of the year as the company took on "on-going expenditure for maintenance."
He forecast Porterbrook would still perform strongly, although margins would not be as high as in the first six weeks.
Total sales in the bus operation rose to 232.2 million pounds ($389.3 million) against 189.2 million ($317.2 million), yielding profits of 34.6 million ($58 million) versus 29.0 million ($48.6 million).
South West Trains, a new business, saw sales of 128 million pounds ($214.6 million) and profits of 500,000 pounds ($838,222).
Porterbrook sales were 33.6 million pounds ($56.3 million), with 13.5 million ($22.6 million) profit and Swebus sales came in at 11.3 million ($18.9 million), with 600,000 pounds ($1 million) in profit.
Stagecoach, which started out as a brother and sister team in Scotland, was floated in 1993 at 112 pence ($1.87) a share. The share price has doubled this year.
