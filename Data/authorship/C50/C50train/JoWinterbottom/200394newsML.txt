London Electricity on Tuesday became the latest British regional electricity company (Rec) to attract bid speculation after U.S. firm Entergy was reported to be mulling a 1.2 billion pound ($2 billion) bid.
London Electricity declined comment on a report in the Wall Street Journal Europe that confidential documents showed the U.S. company was seeking 1.1 billion pounds to acquire an unnamed British electricity firm whose financial profile matched that of London Electricity.
Entergy told Reuters that any talks with another party were "too early in the scheme of things to be really meaningful."
"As far as specifying a target of that interest, we're not simply going to comment on what has been speculated and rumoured," Entergy spokesman Patrick Sweeney said.
However, he declined to deny the Wall Street Journal Europe article.
Shares in London Electicity touched a high of 671 pence before easing back to close at 667 pence, up 30-1/2 pence. The newspaper article said confidential Entergy company documents referred to used a code name "Atlantic" for the target company whose financial profile met that of London Electricity on a number of points.
The Journal said the bid was assumed in the documents to be for around 700 pence per share. The newspaper quoted Entergy's Sweeney as saying Entergy was interested in the British market and "obviously if you're interested, one of the results could be an acquisition."
The article followed a denial by Entergy on Monday of a report in Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper that the U.S. firm was considering a bid for Yorkshire Electricity Group Plc. The electricity sector has seen a flurry of bid speculation recently over the five remaining independent Recs. Northern Electric currently faces its second hostile offer in less than two years as it tries to fend off a $1.225 billion ($1=.5994 Pound)
