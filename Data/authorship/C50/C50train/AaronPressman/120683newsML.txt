Elementary school students with access to the Internet learned more than kids who lacked access, an indepedent research group concluded after conducting a comparative study in seven urban school districts.
"This study dramatically illustrates the positive effects of online use on learning," said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, an association of 49 large inner city public school districts which co-sponsored the study along with Scholastic Corp.
