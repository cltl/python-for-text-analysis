Embattled Nomura Securities Co Ltd is expected to announce on Thursday the best results among more than 280 brokerages in Japan for the last business year, but prospects for the current year are gloomy.
Analysts said on Monday that Nomura's profits for the fiscal year which ended on March 31 should be far ahead of its competitors thanks to huge profits in bond trading and bond underwriting.
However, they added that business for Nomura in the 1997/98 year would be sharply undermined by a scandal, with the size of the expected profit drop depending on how hard the Finance Ministry comes down on Japan's largest brokerage after regulators complete their investigation.
Japanese prosecutors and securities watchdog are investigating Nomura for suspected illegal deals involving "sokaiya" racketeers, who extort money from a company by threatening to disturb shareholders' meetings.
In January, Nomura announced pre-tax, parent current profit of 103.69 billion yen ($829 million) for the first nine months of 1996/97, against 91.49 billion yen ($731 million) in actual current profit for the the full 1995/96 year.
"Nomura is expected to be the top in earnings in 1996/97 with profits of more than 100 billion yen ($800 million)," said Ayako Sato, an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd.
Other analysts said they expect Nomura to post parent current profit -- pre-tax profit which includes gains and losses made on securities investments and other non-operating activities -- of between 120 billion ($952 million) and 140 billion yen ($1.11 billion).
In the first nine months, Nomura posted 81.82 billion yen ($654 million) in stock brokering commission against 105.66 billion yen ($845 million) in 1995/96. Net gains on bond trading stood at 66.33 billion yen ($530 million) in the first nine months against 71.54 billion yen ($572 million).
But industry sources said they would not be surprised if Nomura posts a loss in the current year because many institutional and corporate investors have suspended their business with Nomura since it revealed on March 6 that two of its directors were involved in the suspected illegal deals.
Nomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it has held since February 1992.
If Nomura's market share falls by 10 percent, it will lose 12 billion yen ($96 million) in commissions, analysts said.
In addition, Nomura's underwriting business has also been hit by the scandal.
The business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported last week that Nomura had underwritten only 2.5 percent of the domestic straight bonds issued so far in April, compared with 14 percent for all of the previous business year.
Three other big brokerages -- Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, Nikko Securities Co Ltd  8603 T and Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd -- are also scheduled to announce their 1996/97 results later this month.
Analysts estimate Yamaichi's parent current profit at nil in 1996/97 against profits of 15.13 billion yen ($121 million) in the profit in 1995/96, and Nikko to have profit of 40 billion yen ($320 million), down from a profit of 65 billion yen ($520 million).
They expect Daiwa to post profit of 60 billion yen ($480 million), down slightly from 62.56 billion yen ($500 million).
