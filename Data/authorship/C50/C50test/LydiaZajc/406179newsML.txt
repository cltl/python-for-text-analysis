Toronto stocks ended mixed in active trading on Tuesday as a rally in heavyweight bank stocks was offset by profit-taking in other groups.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index rose 5.26 points to close at 6247.78 on volume of 105.75 million shares worth C$1.67 billion ($1.23 billion).
But the overall market was mixed with declining issues outpacing advances 525 to 463, with 307 stocks unchanged.
"All the activity was centered in the bank sector ... fueled by some solid earnings," said Ira Katzin, investment advisor at RBC Dominion Securities.
The financial services group, which accounts for 17.55 percent of the 300 index, jumped almost 2.1 percent after two big Canadian banks reported strong first-quarter earnings.
The banks led five of the TSE's 14 sub-indices higher, which also included forest products and media. But these gains were offset by profit-taking in conglomerates, energy, consumer products and base metals.
Looking ahead, analysts said investors are awaiting U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on Wednesday.
Among bank stocks, Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia soared after they reported sharply higher first quarter profits.
Bank of Montreal gained 1.10 to 49.50 on 899,000 shares, while Bank of Nova Scotia jumped 1.25 to 52.90 on 1.1 million shares.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce posted the biggest gain, climbing 1.60 to 67 on 908,000 shares.
Sherritt International topped the most-active list, ending up 1.00 at 59.00 on 7.9 million shares, after earlier reaching a 52-week high of 60.
Sherritt improved after chief executive Ian Delaney defended the company's controversial investments in Cuba in a speech to Toronto's business community on Monday.
